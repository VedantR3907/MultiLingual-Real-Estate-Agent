therein also transferred and the term property includes the properties of all description i.e.

of a joint property.

Surrender is merging of a lesser interest in a greater interest in such a manner that the 
greater inter interest is not enlarged and it is not a transfer of a property under section 5 of 
Transfer of Property Act. Perfect example of Surrender is where a lease holder surrenders 
its right in favour of the owner.

respect of some property and it is also not a transfer.
INDIAN PROPERTY SHOW, LONDON

Relinquishment
A relinquishment is extinguishment of a right, therefore, it cannot amount 
to a transfer. A relinquishment by a reversioner of his reversionary 
interest does not amount to transfer. Where a person in whose favour the 
release is executed gets certain rights by virtue of such release and such 
transaction may amount to transfer.

If a contract to transfer future property is made, it will not be enforced 
before the property comes into existence. The contract to transfer future 
property will be specifically performed only on coming into existence 
of that property.

DEED OF CONFIRMATION TO RECTIFY ERRORS
A deed of confirmation is made to rectify an error in a deed. The error 
may be in the spelling of a name, property description, address, or in 
execution. This deed is also referred to as a correction deed. 
A confirmation may be made either by acquiescence by limitation or by 
a deed.
The Indian Registration Act recognizes a confirmation deed. According 
to Section 17 of the Act, any deed confirming an interest in property 
needs to be registered. A confirmation deed attracts stamp duty.
INDIAN PROPERTY SHOW, LONDON 
APRIL 2016

In case the main document is registered or to be registered, a 
corresponding confirmation deed also requires registration.
It is to be noted that legal documents involving property are lengthy and 
voluminous. Errors may creep into the main documents of sale, 
mortgage, or lease. The errors are corrected through supplementary 
documents such as a deed of confirmation, rectification deed or 
cancellation deed.
Through the deed the parties give consent to a transaction already 
executed. Through this confirmation, the party further strengthens and 
gives legal validity to the estate. In case of a confirmation deed, a person 
may confirm and assent to the documents of conveyance executed by 
another person. This is required when a person is not made a party to the 
main document of conveyance by oversight or ignorance.
INDIAN PROPERTY SHOW, LONDON 
APRIL 2016

An agreement for sale, mortgage, lease, partition, licence etc may be 
cancelled by the parties with the consent of all parties involved in the 
transaction.
In case all the parties do not consent to the cancellation, the affected 
party needs to seek the intervention of the court by filing a suit in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Specific Relief Act. 
It is important to note that a duly executed and registered deed of 
conveyance cannot be cancelled by a deed of cancellation only. The 
parties need to execute a reconveyance deed and get it registered too.

Execution of documents
To "execute a document" can mean to bring it into effect.
However, it can also mean to carry out the formalities (signature, 
sealing, etc) needed to bring the document into effect, and in this case it 
probably means to sign it as one of the principals (rather than simply as 
a witness).
