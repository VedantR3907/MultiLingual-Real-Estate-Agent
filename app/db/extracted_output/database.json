There are too many factors that go into determining the value of a property, including:\n\n* Location\n* Square footage\n* Number of bedrooms and bathrooms\n* Age of the house\n* Condition of the house\n* Lot size\n* Amenities\n* Market conditions \n\nTo get a realistic estimate of the price, you would need to contact a real estate agent in the area. \n"
