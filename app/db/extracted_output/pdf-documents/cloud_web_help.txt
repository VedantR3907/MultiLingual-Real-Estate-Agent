Getting Started
Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway | Forcepoint Web Security Cloud Help
Cloud web protection products protect your organization against the threats of 
malware, spam, and other unwanted content in web traffic.
The following web products are available in the cloud: 
●
Forcepoint URL Filtering offers malware protection and customizable web 
content categories, enabling you to create highly granular acceptable use policies.
●
Forcepoint Web Security Cloud includes the above features, plus real-time 
security analysis, real-time content classification, detection of inappropriate 
content in dynamic websites, granular configuration for social web controls, and 
SSL decryption by category.
The cloud service offers the following add-ons for web products:
●
The I Series appliance is an add-on to Forcepoint Web Security Cloud, and 
provides on-premises URL analysis and application/protocol detection for web 
traffic, along with centralized policy management and reporting capabilities in the 
cloud. When policy indicates that a request requires additional analysis, it is 
transparently routed to the cloud, where cloud analytics are applied and policy is 
enforced.
●
The Advanced Malware Detection for Web module enables you to send 
suspicious files to a cloud-hosted sandbox for further analysis.
You configure and administer these services using the Forcepoint Cloud Security 
Gateway Portal, also referred to in this Help as the Security Portal, or the cloud portal. 
The portal provides a central, graphical interface to the general configuration, policy 
management, and reporting functions of your web protection service, making it easy 
to define and enforce web security. 
To get started, see:
●
Initial steps
●
Logging on and portal security
●
Navigating the cloud portal

Getting Started

Initial steps
If you have not already done so, take the following steps to get started. If you are not 
able to complete all of the in-network configuration steps immediately, you can 
complete them after you perform the cloud portal configuration steps.
1.
Configure your firewall to allow connectivity to the cloud service. 
See Configuring your firewall to connect to the cloud service.
2.
Log on to the Security Portal. 
See Logging on and portal security, page 2, for instructions.
3.
Add your Internet gateway IP addresses to your policy.
See Proxied connections, page 161, for instructions.
4.
Configure end-user authentication (if required).
If you have not already completed these steps, please see the Getting Started Guide 
for detailed instructions.
Logging on and portal security
To access the portal, visit https://admin.forcepoint.net/portal. (For tips on navigation 
the portal, see Navigating the cloud portal, page 9.)
The logon process uses cookies where possible. For the best user experience, we 
recommend that you accept cookies from the Security Portal. If your web browser is 
unable to, or is configured not to accept cookies from the portal, an additional screen 
appears during logon reminding you of the benefits of securing your session.
If the portal cannot use cookies to secure the session, it falls back to ensuring that all 
requests for the session come from the same IP address. This may cause problems for 
you if your company has several load-balanced web proxies, because the portal 
perceives requests coming from several sources as a security breach. Companies with 
a single web proxy or a cooperating web proxy farm should not be affected.
To avoid problems, we recommend enabling cookies on your web browsers.
Privacy statement
The portal uses 2 cookies during logon. The first is used to identify whether the user’s 
web browser is willing to accept and store cookies for the portal; it contains no 
information. If the first cookie is successfully stored, a second cookie is stored 
Note
To use the Security Portal, your browser must have JavaScript enabled.

containing temporary information about the session. No personal information is stored 
in either cookie, and both cookies are used only for the duration of the session.
Idle timeout
For security reasons, if you are logged on to your cloud service account and are 
inactive for a pre-defined period, you are automatically logged off. When you next 
attempt to perform an action, you are asked to log on again. Once you have done so, 
you are taken to the area of the portal that you requested. The inactivity timer is 
between 30 and 60 minutes.
Customizable landing page
By default, administrators logging onto the portal are taken to the Account > Licenses 
page. To change your landing page:
1.
Navigate to the page you would like to use as your portal landing page.
2.
Click the arrow next to your logon account name in the banner at the top of the 
page.
3.
Select Set Landing Page.
Note that some pages have been deliberately excluded from supporting this option.
Cloud Web setup
Setting up cloud web involves a combination of steps performed in your network (to 
allow communication with the cloud service) and steps performed in the cloud portal 
(policy configuration).
If you are not able to complete all of the in-network configuration steps immediately, 
you can complete them after you perform the cloud portal configuration steps.

Configuring your firewall to connect to the cloud service
In order for the cloud service to manage web traffic from your network, your firewall 
must allow TCP connections outbound to Forcepoint data centers on specific ports. 
The table below details the ports that may be used, depending on your configuration. 
In addition to the above, ports 80 and 443 can be used by:
●
Block and notification page components, including stylesheets and images, served 
from a separate website used by the cloud infrastructure (not directly through the 
cloud proxy).
●
Non-proxied destinations. IP addresses and domains configured using the Proxy 
Bypass setting are configured to route directly to the origin server. Browsers will 
connect directly via port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS). 
●
The roaming home page. Although this service is principally for remote users, you 
may choose to configure all browsers to use this as their home page. This page is 
always unproxied when using cloud service PAC files.

Tip
To guarantee availability, Forcepoint Web Security Cloud uses global load balancing 
to direct traffic across multiple geographic locations. In the event of localized 
connectivity issues, data center load balancing automatically routes requests to the 
next closest location. To make the most of the resilience offered by this 
infrastructure, users must be allowed to connect to the entire cloud network.
For details of the IP address ranges in use by cloud service data centers, see the 
article Cloud service IP addresses and port numbers in the Forcepoint Knowledge 
Base.

Getting Started
●
The proxy query page. Users can access a query page to find out whether their 
browser settings are correct for accessing the proxy.
  
Sending end user information to the cloud service
End user information can be sent to the cloud service in one of 3 ways:
●
Use System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) (recommended when 
using a cloud directory service) to provision user and group identity data from a 
cloud-based identity provider to the cloud service.
See Configuring SCIM.
●
Directory synchronization (recommended when using a private Active Directory 
or LDAP) involves installing the Directory Synchronization Client in your 
network and configuring it to synchronize user and group information from your 
LDAP directory to the cloud service.
See Configuring the Directory Synchronization Client.
●
Manually enter end user information (name, email address, and NTLM identity) 
to use in testing. User details are added to policies using the End Users tab 
options.
See Adding users manually.
Configuring SCIM
Your identity provider must be configured to work with the cloud service so that user 
and group data can be synchronized from the provider. See Configure identity 
management for more details.
Configuring the Directory Synchronization Client
To enable directory synchronization between your LDAP directory and the cloud 
service, start by creating a contact with Directory Synchronization permissions. The 
user name and password will be used by the Directory Synchronization Client to 
connect to the cloud service.
Refer to the Directory Synchronization Client Administrator’s Guide for further 
information, including how to download and configure the client software. 
Note
Remote users should use the alternate PAC file addresses (using port 80 or 443) if 
requesting access from networks that may have port 8081, 8082, or 8087 locked 
down. 
Note
Okta and Microsoft Azure Active Directory are the only identity provided currently 
supported.

Adding users manually
User accounts that you plan to use for testing can be added when a new policy is 
added. See the step for Adding end users when setting up a policy.
Setting up your first policy
Use the Web > Policy Management > Policies page to create a basic policy to 
determine which websites can and cannot be accessed by users whose traffic is 
managed by the cloud service.
This process walks you through creating a very basic policy that you can customize 
later if necessary. See Creating a new policy for complete instructions and details.
1.
Click Add.
2.
Enter a policy name and administrator email address. This email address is used 
as the address from which system messages are sent. 
3.

■
Default blocks access to sites in commonly blocked categories, like Adult 
Material, Gambling, and sites that present a security risk, while permitting 
access to sites commonly used for business or educational purposes.
■
Basic blocks the most frequently blocked categories and permits the rest.
■
Security only blocks only sites that present a security risk (like phishing-
related sites or sites that host malware) and permits access to all others.
■
Monitor only does not block any websites, but does log user activity for use 
in reporting.

Configuring permissions
By default, all rights are assigned to the master user (the initial contact established in 
your account, with super administrator privileges). When the master user creates a 
new user, by default only the View All Reports permission is assigned to that account. 
This is the minimum permission a user needs to be able to log on; it grants 
permissions over only the Reporting tab on the main menu bar.
We provide flexible users’ rights so you can create a hierarchy of administrators. For 
example, much of the functionality accessed from the portal is useful for help desk 
agents to aid with problem isolation; but they do not necessarily require control over 
policy configuration. 
Likewise, you should assign Directory Synchronization privileges to the contact you 
set up for the Directory Synchronization Client (see Set up authentication (Directory 
Synchronization only), page 57), but no-one else should need this privilege.
Permissions are granted at an account and policy level. This lets you create multiple 
policies, and administrators can control their own policy but no one else’s. 
To modify an administrator user’s permissions:
1.
On the Account > Contacts page, click the name of the user whose permissions 
you want to edit in the User Name column of the Contacts table (not the Full 
Name column).
2.
Click Edit.
3.
Under Account Permissions, mark or clear check boxes to add or remove 
permissions.
Refer to the list below for more information about each permission set.

Use the Policy Permissions table to add or remove policy, audit trail, and related 
permissions.
■
Refer to the list below for information about each permission set.
■
To refine policy-level permissions, click Advanced.
5.
Use the Group Filtering for Cloud Web Reporting options to restrict reporting 
access to selected groups.
Note
Visibility for some account and policy permissions depends upon the permission 
being assigned to your administrator account. If your administrator account does not 
have full account level permissions, you are only able to view or modify settings for 
policies you have been explicitly given permissions to. For example, full account 
level permission is required to access the Global Custom Category list.
Note
The Advanced button does not show for contacts with Manage Users permissions, 
because their selected permissions will apply to all policies.

Password policy
A password policy defines how “strong” your users’ passwords are required to be. (A 
strong password is a secure password.) The password policy in the cloud portal sets 
the minimum length, maximum length, password history, sequence rules, and unique 
character rules of a user’s password.
Following are the minimum requirements: 
In addition, passwords:
●
Cannot contain the user’s logon ID
●
Cannot contain common words or keyboard sequences
●
Must include uppercase letters
●
Must include lowercase letters
●
Must include numbers

Two-factor authentication
Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) provides an additional level of 
security for administrator access to the cloud portal. When this setting is applied, all 
portal users using a password to sign in are required to enter both their password and a 
code generated by an authenticator app.
To enable two-factor authentication for all portal users:
1.
Go to the Account > Contacts page.
2.
Toggle the Two-factor authentication switch to ON. 
3.
Click Save. 
The next time portal users log on, they will be prompted to set up two-factor 
authentication.
Logging on with two-factor authentication
When two-factor authentication is enabled for your account, all administrators require 
an authenticator app to access the portal. This app must be configured before the user 
can log on.
When users log on with two-factor authentication for the first time (or after their 
account has been reset), a setup wizard guides them through the configuration process. 
In the wizard, portal users who do not already have an authenticator app are given 
instructions for downloading Microsoft Authenticator. 
During the setup process, portal users are prompted to:
1.
Select a supported authenticator app.
2.
Set up the app by scanning a QR code shown on the screen or by manually 
entering a secret key.

Note
Compatible authenticator apps are available for Android, iOS, Blackberry, and 
Windows Phone. Desktop and browser-based apps are also available for Microsoft 
Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. This feature is validated with the Microsoft

Algorithm (TOTP) protocol, such as Google Authenticator, are also supported.

3.
Enter the 6-digit code shown on the authenticator app.
Once setup has been completed successfully, users are logged on to the portal. 
Each time users subsequently log on with their password, they are also prompted to 
enter the code displayed on their authenticator app. Users have 3 attempts to enter a 
valid code before being asked to re-enter their password.
Resetting two-factor authentication for a portal user
For portal users who have been locked out, or who cannot use their authenticator app 
(for example, users who have lost their phone), an administrator with the appropriate 
permissions can reset the user’s two-factor authentication status. This requires the user 
to complete the setup process again.
To reset a user’s two-factor authentication status:
1.
Go to the Account page. 
2.
Click the username of the user whose account needs to be reset to open the User 
page. Under Log On Details, the current two-factor authentication status for the 
user is shown, including the date and time that setup was completed.
3.
Click Reset to reset the user’s authentication status.
The user will be prompted to repeat the two-factor authentication setup process when 
next logging on.

administrator single sign-on has not been enabled and configured. Administrators 
are required to enter a user name and password if this option is selected. When 
two-factor authentication is enabled, administrators are prompted to enter the 
code displayed on their authenticator app.
●
SSO + Password: When this option is selected, administrators may sign in to the 
cloud portal using a user name and password, or the single sign-on option. When 
two-factor authentication is enabled, administrators using the password option are 
prompted to enter the code displayed on their authenticator app.
●
SSO: Administrators must sign in to the portal using single sign-on. If necessary, 
administrators who have Managed User permissions are allowed to sign in using a 
user name and password as a fallback option. If this fallback option is used, and 
two-factor authentication is enabled, administrators are prompted to enter the 
code displayed on their authenticator app.

Licenses
Our subscription model operates in a similar manner to many software vendors: to use 
the service, you must accept the terms of your agreement. Once you have done this, 
your services are automatically enabled, renewed, or upgraded depending upon the 
subscription type.
The purchase and billing systems are fully integrated with the cloud portal. Each cloud 
service has a subscription associated with it, and that subscription is applied to each 
customer account.
To view the subscriptions associated with your account, go to Account > Licenses. 
You can use this area of the portal to view and manage your rights to use cloud 
services.
Warning
If you already have groups in place for web users and there are dependencies 
between the groups and rules, selecting Replace all groups with CSV file could 
void exceptions to your rules. (For example, if a rule states that no one but the 
Accounting group can access www.financialnews.com, and then you upload a new 
Group list, it is possible that Accounting could lose access to that website.)
To maintain existing group/rule associations, make sure that group names in the 
CSV file match group names in the portal exactly. The best way to achieve this is to 
download existing group configurations to a PC, manipulate them as needed, then 
upload the changes to the cloud.

included in log records generated by Data Security (DLP Lite). 
In addition, when the timeout is exceeded, the request is blocked or allowed based on 
the fallback selection but no log record is generated.
Important rules for configuring accounts
●
Your account can enforce multiple policies on your email and web traffic. 
●
It is good practice to keep the number of policies to a minimum, because if a 
global change is required, you must make it across all policies.
●
To prevent accidental changes, many configuration options are grayed out until 
you click the appropriate edit box.
●
Each service has its own configuration screen accessed by clicking the appropriate 
tab on the main policy setup screen. Regardless of the services that you are 
licensed to use, you see all tabs. If you click the tab for a service that you are not 
licensed to use, you are informed of such.
●
Where multiple email addresses, domains, or user names are entered into a screen, 
they should be separated by commas.
●
You can click Help at any time to access online help information.
●
All changes are made in real time and usually only take a few minutes to 
propagate across the cloud infrastructure. 
●
Cloud web products analyze inbound and outbound web traffic as well. Most 
settings in the policy screens are specified separately for inbound and outbound 
policy application. It is often not appropriate to set these identically for each 
direction. 
To access a web policy, go to the Web > Policy Management > Policies page.
On the Policies page, you are presented with a choice of service-specific policies.
Important 
Requests that include files that exceed 10MB in size are not forwarded to Data 
Protection Service. These requests are allowed and no log record is generated.

Working with External 
Directories
The cloud service allows you to make use of System for Cross-domain Identity 
Management (SCIM) or LDAP directories, such as Active Directory, so you don’t 
have to re-create user accounts and groups for your email and web services or manage 
users and groups in two places. 
User identity information maintained in a cloud-based service such as Okta or 
Microsoft Azure Active Directory can be forwarded to the cloud service using SCIM. 
Changes made to the user information are forwarded to the cloud automatically.
The cloud service optionally synchronizes with LDAP directories via a client-resident 
application known as the Directory Synchronization Client. Changes made to a                  
directory, such as deleting a former employee or adding a new one, are picked up by 
the service on the next scheduled update. If you have more than one LDAP directory, 
the client can merge them together before synchronizing the data with the service. 
For cloud web products, if you have set up the account for NTLM identification and 
synchronized NTLM IDs, end users do not need to register for the service on the 
portal (unless they are traveling outside of the network).

Note
SCIM is not supported with Forcepoint Email Security Cloud.
Important
The cloud service supports only one instance of the Directory Synchronization

using multiple installations of the Directory Synchronization Client, can cause data 
on the cloud service to be overwritten.

What is SCIM?
System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is a protocol used to 
provision user and group identity data from a cloud-based identity provider to the 
cloud service. Updates to user information in the identity provider are automatically 
forwarded to the cloud service as they happen. 
Email Address
The customer organization must ensure that the right value is being set currently for 
the user email before enabling SCIM. Failure to do this will lead to incorrectly 
provisioned users and loss of log history.
How the service works with SCIM
The cloud-based identity provider is configured with the URL of the System for 
Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) interface made available by the cloud 
service.
1.
User and group information in the identity provider are assigned to the cloud 
service integration.
2.
Each change to a user or group on the identity provider is sent to the cloud service 
via Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS).
3.
The uploaded data is stored in the cloud service, alongside any user and group 
data managed directly via the Security Portal.
Important
An NTLM ID is required when Forcepoint One Endpoint (Classic Proxy Connect or 
Direct Connect Endpoint) is used with SCIM and users are synchronized from the 
cloud directory. Refer to the Knowledge Base Article that explains how to configure 
SCIM with your preferred cloud directory.
Note that, while the NTLM ID is not required when Neo is used with SCIM, it is 
highly recommended that one be provided for consistency.
Note
●
SCIM is not supported with Forcepoint Email Security Cloud.
●
If NTLM based identification is used in the customer deployment, then the 
NTLM ID for the user should also be sent over SCIM. This is a recommendation 
only.

The identity provider authenticates with the cloud service using a token generated 
in the portal and copied into the identity provider configuration.
What is LDAP?
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a networking protocol for querying 
and modifying directory services. An LDAP directory contains data with similar 
attributes and organizes data in a directory tree structure. It is considered 
“lightweight” because it is a reduced version of the X.500 directory standard.
Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft’s LDAP-compliant directory service, and is an 
integral part of the Windows Server architecture. Active Directory is a hierarchical 
framework of resources (such as printers), services (such as email), and users (user 
accounts and groups). It allows administrators to assign enterprise-wide policies, 
deploy programs to many computers, and apply critical updates to an entire 
organization.
The cloud service integrates with LDAP directories and has been certified to work 
with Microsoft Active Directory. If you have enterprise information stored in AD, you 
do not have to enter it into the cloud portal manually.
How the service works with LDAP
For each data synchronization:
1.
The Directory Synchronization Client communicates with the LDAP server and 
returns the selected data (users, groups, and email addresses).
Note
Okta and Microsoft Azure Active Directory are the only identity providers currently 
supported.

2.
The Directory Synchronization Client performs a synchronization and returns 
incremental changes to the portal via Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
(HTTPS). You can force a full synchronization when necessary.
3.
The uploaded data is stored in the cloud service, alongside any user and group 
data managed directly via the Security Portal.
4.
If both user and group data is required, the update occurs in 2 transactions. If one 
fails, the other can still succeed. Email addresses are a third transaction.
5.
The client authenticates with the portal using a username and password that you 
establish manually on the Contacts page. (Consider an appropriate password 
expiration policy for that user so you don’t have to regularly update the client 
application with the password changes.)
6.
LDAP synchronized data is viewable but not editable through the portal.
The synchronization client resides on a computer at the customer’s site and accesses 
one or more LDAP directories via the customer’s network. If more than one LDAP 

Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway Portal Help  51
Working with External Directories
directory is accessed, then this data can be merged together by the synchronization 
client before it is synchronized with the cloud service.
Planning for your first synchronization
When you are setting up user provisioning, it is important that you review the data you 
are about to provision. The way that you structure user data in your identity provide or 
LDAP-compliant directory affects how you should structure groups and users in the 
portal for policies and exceptions. You should devise a strategy before you start.

Working with External Directories
52  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
To start, what data do you want to get out of your user data and what do you plan to do 
with it? 
Second, how is that data organized? 
Third, how do you need to structure users and groups in the portal to accommodate 
your security requirements?
In a typical directory, users are members of many groups. For example, users may be 
members of global groups like “All Sales;” they may be members of geographical 
groups like “London” or “New York;” and they may be members of a department such 
as “NY Telesales” and many others. When deciding on which groups to provision, 
select only groups that are going to be useful to the cloud service, typically for setting 
policy or group-based exceptions. See Deciding what to synchronize, page 52 for 
more guidelines on this decision.   
If you already have users and groups in the portal, then you’ll need to determine how 
and whether to adjust that structure to match the data that is to be provisioned (or vice 
versa).
For customers using LDAP, following are the most common use cases. Follow the 
links to review considerations and checklists designed just for you.
●
New customers:
■
Synchronizing users/groups with a single Web policy and exceptions
■
Synchronizing users/groups with more than one policy, and planning to 
manage policy assignment through an LDAP directory
■

Working with External Directories
You do not need to provision all of the groups and users in your directory. Instead, 
provision only groups that are useful to the cloud service. 
Consider this example:
If you are going to set up a policy for members of a US Telesales department that 
gives them special permission to access certain websites, you should provision the 
“US Telesales” group. There is no need to provision the “London” group if you are not 
going to set up geographical policies in the cloud service, even if the London users are 
going to be using the service. 
Sometimes when users are provisioned to the cloud service, they are members of 
multiple groups, but only a subset of those groups is provisioned. This is not a 
problem: the cloud service is designed to accept users with group references that are 
not on the service.
Synchronizing with SCIM
Synchronization of user and group data occurs automatically after the identity 
provider is configured with:
●
The base URL provided in the SCIM Settings section of the Account > Identity 
Management portal page. 
●
The token generated on the Account > Identity Management page.
●
provisioning details required by the specific identity provider.
See Configure identity management.
When the identity provider notifies the cloud service of the updates, new user 
information is added to a policy. It can take a number of minutes before all new 
information is propagated and policies are assigned to users as expected.

Working with External Directories
54  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
Synchronizing with the Directory Synchronization Client
You specify which groups to synchronize using an LDAP search facility on the 
Directory Synchronization Client,. There is great flexibility in selecting the 
appropriate data to synchronize. For example, you can use the membership of an 
LDAP group attribute to select the users you want, even though you may not select 
that group in the group synchronization setup itself. 
Regardless of how many groups you synchronize, user detail must be sent as part of a 
separate user synchronization. When you synchronize a group, you transfer 
information about the group but not about its contents. User synchronizations include 
details of the group(s) to which users belong. When you apply a web policy or an 
email policy to a synchronized group, that policy is applied to all synchronized users 
who are members of that group.
Please refer to the Directory Synchronization Client Administrator’s Guide in the 
Technical Library for more information on using the LDAP search feature to target 
only those users and groups that are required.
Basic steps
Although the steps for your use case may vary, the basic steps for setting up user 
provisioning follow:
In the portal
1.
Configure identity management, page 55, for your account.
2.
When using SCIM, configure your identity provider, providing details from the 
SCIM Settings section of Account > Identity Management.
3.
When using the Directory Synchronization, Set up authentication (Directory 
Synchronization only), page 57, for the client machine. The client should have its 
own username and password to gain access to the cloud service.
Note
Support for Directory Synchronization Client is limited to the most recent version 
and the version that immediately preceded it.
Note
If you add or change a group name in Active Directory or move a group from one 
organizational unit (OU) to another, be sure to add the new name to the group 
inclusion list on the Directory Synchronization Client before the next 
synchronization. Otherwise, the group is deleted from the portal.

On the client (Directory Synchronization only)
1.
Download the Directory Synchronization Client (see Client tasks (Directory 
Synchronization only), page 58) and install it on a network client machine. 
Download the client administrator’s guide as well. This contains valuable 
information on helping you integrate your directory service with the cloud 
service. 
2.
Configure the client. Use the username and password established in the Contacts 
section of the portal to authenticate.
3.
Test the Directory Synchronization Client to make sure it is returning the correct 
data from the LDAP server to the client. If you are an existing customer switching 
to directory synchronization for the first time, you should compare the data with 
that which already exists in the cloud.
4.
Initiate a synchronization. The service updates its groups and users, including 
policy assignment where appropriate.
If a synchronization is unsuccessful, you can use the Restore feature to restore the 
directory information to a previous version. (See Restore directories, page 62 for 
more information.)
5.
Schedule automatic synchronization. You can update the cloud service several 
times a day if required. 
Refer to the Directory Synchronization Client Administrator’s Guide for instructions 
on items 2-5.

If you are a new customer with no group data in the cloud, leave this box 
unchecked. 
If you have existing data, check this box if you want to overwrite current 
groups with the provisioned groups when there is a group name conflict. 
Users, groups, and email addresses are overwritten by LDAP data of the same 
name. Once this occurs, they are manageable only by LDAP synchronization. 
If you are switching to LDAP for the first time, take care to match your LDAP 
group names and membership to the existing setup. Doing so allows existing 
policy selections and settings to be maintained, as well as existing usernames/
passwords where applicable. 
If you have duplicate names, you have 2 options: make sure the duplicate can 
be overwritten or don’t allow overwriting and rename the duplicates to avoid 
a conflict.
If you don’t select this option and duplicate names are found, the transaction 
is rejected. In the cloud, you receive the error “403: Attempt to overwrite 
portal-managed group ‘nnnn’.” On the client, you receive “Error

Under Web:
■
Specify whether you want the User policy assignment to be fixed after the 
initial user provisioning, or if you want the service to check the group policy 
membership every time users are provisioned or group policy assignments are 
changed in the cloud.
○
Select Fixed if you want to manage policy assignments in the cloud. When 
this option is selected, the service makes a policy assessment for an 
individual user only when that user first appears in the system (in other 
words, is synchronized for the first time). It either assigns the user a group-
based policy or the default policy specified above. If you want to move 
someone to a new policy, you need to do so in the cloud.
○
Select Follow group membership if you want users’ policy assignments 
to change automatically when there are changes to their group

 Assign a group to a different policy
You can modify the web policy to which members (i.e., users) of synchronized groups 
are to be assigned. This assignment takes place either when the user is initially created 
on the cloud service or when group membership or group policy assignment changes, 
depending on how you configured the User policy assignment setting on the Identity 
Management page (see Configure identity management, page 55).

If you set User policy assignment to Follow group membership when you 
configured directory synchronization, the effect of this action is to assign all members 
of the group already in the service to this policy. Users that are not members of 
groups, or users in groups that are not explicitly assigned to a policy, are automatically 
assigned to the default policy. All future additional users who are members of the 
group are synchronized into the policy as well.

Configure General settings
Use the Web > Settings > General page to access information about how traffic is 
routed for your account.
By default, end user web traffic is routed to the nearest cloud point of presence (data 
center or local PoP) based on the egress IP address of your Domain Name Server 
(DNS). If your DNS is in a different geographic location from some or all of your end 
users, this may mean that traffic is not routed to the nearest point of presence to those 
users. To route your web traffic to points of presence based on the location of the end 
user, rather than your DNS, mark Route traffic based on end users’ egress IP.
The General page also includes the following reference information:
●
The proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file defines how web browsers choose an 
appropriate proxy for fetching a given URL or whether it should be fetched 
directly from the server of origin. For more information, see Proxy auto-
configuration (PAC), page 66.
●
The proxy query page enables you to determine if a browser is correctly 
configured. For more information, see Proxy query page, page 69.
●
The web monitoring tool allows you to check web connectivity and speed. For 
more information, see Web performance monitor, page 70.
●
The roaming home page is designed for remote users, enabling them to connect to 
the Internet via the cloud service from any location. For more information, see 
Roaming home page, page 71.
Proxy auto-configuration (PAC)
We recommend that for all web browsers that will connect directly to the cloud proxy, 
you use the PAC file configured within the cloud service. This file contains a number 
of global settings and allows you to enter exclusions of your own (for example, 
intranet sites) that should not use the cloud service proxy (see Proxy bypass, page 
163).
The exact mechanism for configuring a user’s browser to use the PAC file depends on 
the browser and your network environment. For example, if you are using Microsoft 
Active Directory and Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, you might want to 
automate the process by using group policies.

Configuring Web Settings
There are a number of different URLs you can use to retrieve a service-generated PAC 
file. The URL you choose determines which version of the PAC file is retrieved. 
Different variants of the PAC file are suited to different network environments. 
Default and alternate PAC file addresses
PAC file addresses can be located on the Web > General page and on the General tab 
of a policy. In both locations, a default and alternate address is listed.
●
Default PAC file address: the PAC file is retrieved over port 8082 by default, or 
8087 for HTTPS. Browsing with this PAC file is performed via port 8081. 
●
Alternate PAC file addresses: the PAC file is retrieved over port 80 by default, or 
443 for HTTPS. Web browsing is also performed via ports 80/443. Useful for 
locations where non-standard ports are locked down.
Both default and alternate PAC files can be retrieved via HTTP, or over a secure 
HTTPS connection. Select the HTTP or HTTPS URL as required. See Accessing PAC 
files over HTTPS, page 69.
Default PAC file addresses
Default PAC file URLs are in the following format:
http://pac.webdefence.global.blackspider.com:8082/proxy.pac
https://pac.webdefence.global.blackspider.com:8087/proxy.pac
The default PAC file address retrieves the PAC file over port 8082 (or 8087 for 
HTTPS). Web browsing is performed via port 8081.
This URL should be used where ports 8081 and 8082/8087 are permitted, such as your 
corporate network. 
For more information on which ports are required to use the cloud service, see 
Configuring your firewall to connect to the cloud service, page 4.
Alternate PAC file addresses
Alternate PAC file URLs are in the following format:
http://pac.webdefence.global.blackspider.com/proxy.pac
https://pac.webdefence.global.blackspider.com:443/proxy.pac
Alternate PAC file URLs use the standard ports for web browsing: port 80 for HTTP 
traffic, and port 443 for HTTPS. This is useful for users who connect from locations 
(such as guest or public networks) where non-standard ports may be locked down.
For locations where ports 8081 and 8082/8087 are locked down, use the alternate PAC 
file address to ensure that users can retrieve the PAC file and browse via the cloud 
service. 
Standard and policy-specific PAC files
Your account has two locations that list PAC file URLs: 

Configuring Web Settings
68  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
●
Standard (account-wide) PAC file URL (found on the Web > General page). This 
URL is an account-wide PAC file URL. This fetches a policy-specific PAC file on 
connections from recognized IP addresses, and the standard, global PAC file from 
unrecognized addresses. 
●
Policy-specific PAC file URL (found on the General tab of a policy). This URL 
includes a policy identifier, which ensures that the PAC file specific to the policy 
is always retrieved. This can be useful to ensure that remote users always get the 
PAC file for a particular policy. 
See the sections below for further information, and guidance on when to use each 
option.
Standard PAC file
The URLs for the standard account-wide PAC file is found on the Web > Settings > 
General page.
When the cloud service receives a request for the standard PAC file, if it knows which 
policy the requester is using, it delivers the PAC file for that policy; otherwise it 
delivers a global PAC file. 
Remote users whose browsers are configured to use the standard PAC file URL will 
receive a global PAC file for the cloud service. 
Policy-specific PAC file
Policy-specific PAC file URLs are in the following form:
http://pac.webdefence.global.blackspider.com:8082/proxy.pac?p=xxxxxx
https://pac.webdefence.global.blackspider.com:8087/proxy.pac?p=xxxxxx
Here, xxxxxx is a unique identifier for your policy.
Your Policy Specific PAC File Address is shown on your policy’s General tab. To 
access this screen, go to the Web > Policy Management > Policies page, then click 
the name of the policy.
You should use the policy-specific PAC file in the following circumstances:
●
You cannot use a proxied connection on your policies. (You do not need to use a 
policy-specific URL when connecting from an IP address configured as a proxied 
connection in a policy, since the policy-specific PAC file is automatically served.)
●
A remote user needs to access bypass destinations specified in the policy-specific 
PAC file, but is able to access these destinations directly, for example, via a VPN 
client.
Note
If you have already deployed a standard cloud PAC file that uses a different URL 
than the one displayed on the page, there is no need to change it unless you wish to. 
PAC file URLs provided with earlier versions of your web product will continue to 
work.

Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway Portal Help  69
Configuring Web Settings
●
A remote user requests access from a network that has port 8082 locked down (or 
port 8087 for HTTPS). In this case, use the alternate PAC file address listed on the 
policy’s General tab. This accesses the PAC file via port 80 (port 443 for HTTPS).
Remote users should also use the alternate policy-specific PAC file address if 
requesting access from a network that has port 8081 locked down. Even if they 
can access the PAC file on port 8082 or 8087, port 8081 is the standard required 
port to be able to use the cloud service.
The policy-specific PAC file allows remote users to always use the correct PAC file 
for their policy, although this is not always appropriate, because bypass destinations 
may not be relevant for the remote users’ locations.
Accessing PAC files over HTTPS
Both standard and policy-specific PAC files can be accessed via HTTP or HTTPS 
URLs. Accessing PAC files over HTTPS provides an additional level of security. The 
standard PAC file HTTPS URL retrieves the PAC file over port 8087. Browsing is 
performed via port 8081.
For users accessing the service via networks where these ports are locked down, the 
alternate HTTPS PAC file URL should be used. This uses port 443 to access the PAC 
file, and port 80 for browsing.
Proxy query page
For clients that use a PAC file to connect to the cloud service, a proxy query page is 
available that allows you to confirm whether the browser is correctly configured. 
(Because clients using the Direct Connect endpoint do not send traffic through the 
proxy, the query page cannot be used to validate connections from these machines.)
Click the Proxy query page link on the General page to see whether you can access 
the query page through the cloud service, or whether you are accessing it directly. You 
receive a message stating either “Yes, you are using the Forcepoint Web Security 
Cloud filtering proxy server” or “No, you are not...”
Important
There is a security implication related to the use of PAC files. If someone could 
guess your unique policy identifier and download it, that person would know what 
sites were not protected by the cloud service and could, in theory, use them as an 
attack vector. To prevent this, PAC file identifiers are generated as non-sequential 
alphanumeric strings. Users cannot assume that the number on either side of their 
PAC file identifier is valid.
For additional security, use the HTTPS PAC file URL. Forcepoint also recommends 
disabling the Automatically detect settings option in your LAN automatic 
configuration settings.

Configuring Web Settings
70  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
To check which point of presence (data center or local PoP) and policy you are 
currently using, as well as connection and HTTP header information, access the query 
page using the following URL (note the “with=all” query):
http://query.webdefence.global.blackspider.com/?with=all
The point of presence hostname is displayed under the Server Information section, in 
the form: aaa##a.srv.mailcontrol.com (for example prx24lonb.srv.mailcontrol.com). 
That data center name is also provided.
Optionally, check the point of presence identifier (e.g. “lonb”) against the knowledge 
article: Cloud service data center IP addresses and port numbers.
Web performance monitor
The web performance monitoring tool is a page that allows you to determine whether 
the cloud service is introducing latency and adversely affecting performance and end-
user experience when accessing certain websites. 
To run a test, click the Monitoring tool link on the Web > General page, then enter 
the web address that you want to test.
Depending on your policy and current location, you may also be required to enter a 
registered user’s email address and password (see Access Control tab, page 164, for 
when and why this is required).
The test sends a request to the specified website both directly and via the proxy to 
which you are connected. The results show the time to receive the first and last bytes 
of the web page returned for each direct and proxied request. The median first byte 
latency provides the best indication of how the cloud service feels to an end user, (i.e., 
generally how quickly the page starts to display). The median last byte latency 
provides an indication of how quickly the page is completely displayed, even though

the end user begins to read or even click another link before the page is displayed 
completely.
The results are affected by any local network and Internet connectivity issues and 
cannot be assumed to prove where a fault lies if a website is responding slowly. 
However they do provide a good indication of whether a slow website response is a 
cloud-related issue or a problem with the website being accessed.
Roaming home page
A roaming user (also known as a remote or offsite user) is someone who is connecting 
to the web from an IP address that has not been configured as a proxied connection on 
any policy.
When roaming users try to proxy through the cloud service from an unknown IP 
address, the service does not know which policy to apply to them and must therefore 

Configuring Web Settings
72  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
serve a non-policy specific notification page asking them to identify themselves. This 
is a global page and cannot be customized.
Once a user is logged on with a unique user ID, the cloud service knows which policy 
to apply to the user.
Challenges supporting roaming users
There are a number of scenarios that must be supported to allow deployment of the 
cloud web service for roaming users. This presents a number of challenges: 
connection difficulties related to browser type, the connectivity method, and many 
other variables. For the latest advice, known issues, and workarounds please check the 
articles in the Knowledge Base and the Getting Started Guide.
Configure Remote Browser Isolation
Available at the account level, the remote browser isolation feature allows a user to 
redirect a blocked request to a remote browser isolation service. A block page, 
available for selection when a category is configured with Block Access, provides the 
user the option to View in Remote Browser. When that option is available and 
selected, the request is forwarded to the provider. See Managing categories, actions,

Configure End User Single Sign-On settings
The end user single sign-on feature uses a third-party identity provider that 
authenticates user identity, attributes, and roles using your enterprise directory. End 
user single sign-on uses the Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML2.0) data 
format to send messages to and receive responses from your identity provider. All 
communications between components are secured.

Configuring Web Settings
If you already have an identity provider supported by the cloud service, you can 
configure your provider to authenticate users browsing via the cloud proxy, enabling 
seamless end-user login.
When end users single sign-on is enabled, end users connecting to the cloud proxy are 
redirected to your identity provider, if specified in their policy. Once a user has been 
authenticated against your directory service, they are directed back to the proxy and 
the appropriate policy is applied. Clients who have authenticated once do not then 
have to re-authenticate for subsequent web browsing sessions, for a specified period 
of time (see Session timeout, page 166).
To configure end user single sign-on:

authentication checks, if required for your end users:
●
The Authentication Bypass tab enables you to add custom settings that bypass 
authentication and content filtering for applications, user agents, and sites for 
which authentication with the cloud service is problematic. If you have an I Series 
appliance or a supported edge device, you can add authentication bypass rules for 
internal networks behind the device. See Bypassing authentication settings, page 
78.
●
The Proxy Bypass tab enables you to add, and import in bulk, destinations that 
bypass the cloud service for all policies. See Adding and importing sites that 
bypass the proxy, page 82.
●
The SSL tab enables you to specify trusted HTTPS domains that your end users 
can always access even if the certificate is detected to be invalid (see Bypassing 
certificate verification, page 84), and to define web categories that should never 
be decrypted for end users authenticating with single sign-on or secure form-
based authentication. For I Series appliances, this applies to all authentication 
methods. See Bypassing authentication decryption, page 85.

Tip
A user agent is identified by a string sent from your browser or Internet application. 
This identifies which browser or application you are using, its version number, and 
details about your system, such as the operating system and version. The destination 
server can use this information to provide content suitable for your specific browser 
or application. For example, this is the user agent information for Firefox:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6)
In this example, Windows NT 5.1 indicates that the operating system is Windows 
XP, and the language setting is US English.

We strongly recommend you do not disable content filtering unless it is for 
applications and sites that do not work with the cloud service and that you trust 
implicitly. Disabling content filtering overrides all other filtering rules, including 
web category filtering actions. This means that all content is allowed. This could 
allow viruses and other malware into your network. 
Note
This option will match against all applications that do not send a user agent. In this 
case, we recommend you refine the rule by entering one or more URLs or domains

To match against all domains and URLs, select All destinations. You might 
want to do this if you are setting up a custom rule that applies to a specific 
user agent that accesses multiple sites.
■
To apply the rule to one or more sites, select Specific destinations, and enter 
each URL or domain on a separate line. URLs must include the protocol 
portion (http://) at the beginning and a forward slash (/) at the end - for 
example, http://www.google.com/. If these elements are not present, the string 
is treated as a domain. Domains cannot include a forward slash at the end - for 
example, mydomain.com.
Use the asterisk wildcard to match one line to multiple destinations: for 
example, entering *.mydomain.com would match against all domains ending 
in ‘mydomain.com.’

Click Save.
To view the user agents that have made authentication requests via the cloud service, 
run the User Agents report (under Reporting > Report Catalog > Advanced). If a 
user agent in this report has a high number of authentication requests, it may be 
experiencing authentication problems. 
Bypassing authentication and filtering for internal networks
If you have an I Series appliance or an approved edge device that connects to the 
cloud service, you can override policy authentication and content filtering settings 
based on the IP addresses in your internal networks, so that specific nodes in a 
network (for example, guest networks) are forced to authenticate using an alternative 
method, or will not be authenticated at all.
If there is a conflict between the settings in this section and the settings in Bypassing 
authentication and filtering for user agents or sites, the IP address settings for the 
internal network take precedence.
To add a setting for an internal network: 
1.
On the Authentication Bypass tab, click Add under Internal Network Traffic.
2.
Enter a Name for the rule. This name appears in the internal networks list on the 
Bypass Settings page, and you can click on it at a later date to edit your settings.
3.
Select the Authentication method for the rule. Note that you can only select a 
fallback option for the authentication type configured in the policy - for example, 
if the policy specifies NTLM identification, you can select Basic or No 
authentication, but not Form login.

Adding and importing sites that bypass the proxy
The Proxy Bypass tab of the Bypass Settings page enables you to define sites that 
bypass the cloud service for all policies. This may include, for example, internal sites 
that are not accessible from the Internet, so the cloud service cannot serve or analyze 
them.
A proxy bypass destination can be a domain name, an IP address, or a subnet.
Note
You must have NTLM identification enabled for your account to use this option.
Warning
We strongly recommend you do not disable content filtering unless it is for 
applications and sites that do not work with the cloud service and that you trust

Both the Proxy Connect and Direct Connect endpoint clients use the bypass 
definitions. In the case of the Neo or Direct Connect endpoint, destinations in the 
bypass list are not analyzed by the cloud service.
●
When a PAC file is used to direct traffic through the cloud proxy, configured 
destinations are added to the PAC file for your organization.
Recommended bypass destinations include organizational webmail sites, internal IP

Bypassing certificate verification
The cloud service verifies certificates for HTTPS sites that it has decrypted and 
analyzed. Certificate verification is enabled by default on the SSL tab of the Bypass 
Settings page, and happens automatically in one of the following cases:
●
SSL decryption has been enabled for web categories (see Web Categories tab, 
page 185).
●
You have enabled notification pages to be served for HTTPS sites (see HTTPS 
notifications, page 118)
●
You are using secure form-based authentication (see Access Control tab, page 
164).
●
You have configured end user single sign-on functionality.
●
You have deployed an I Series appliance and enabled any of the authentication 
methods available in the policy.
Certificate verification checks are numerous and apply to all certificates in the trust 
chain. For example:
●
The certificate must be issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). For a list of 
supported CAs, see the Knowledge Base article What are the trusted Certificate 
Authorities? 
●
The certificate must be current (within its “Valid from...to...” date range).
Note
You can add a total of 1000 proxy bypass destinations per policy. Account-level 
bypass destinations (added via Web > Proxy Bypass) count towards this limit for 
each policy. For example, if your policy has 10 bypass destinations, and you have 10 
account-level bypass destinations, this is counted as a total of 20 destinations for the 
policy.

Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway Portal Help  85
Configuring Web Settings
●
The certificate must not be on a revocation list (either CRL or OCSP).
To choose whether or not to use certificate verification, in the Certificate Verification 
Bypass section on the SSL tab, set Perform certificate verification to On or Off.
If certificate verification fails, the end user sees an error page and cannot access the 
website unless you allow them to access sites with certificate errors by marking Allow 
end users to bypass all certificate errors. In this case, end users see a notification 
page informing them that a certificate error has been detected, and have the option to 
either proceed to the site or go back. This notification page is not available for I Series 
appliances.
If you choose to perform certificate verification, you can maintain a list of domains 
and IP addresses for which the cloud service bypasses certificate verification errors. 
This enables end users to visit a site even if the certificate is invalid. You may want to 
do this for sites that you trust even if, for example, the certificate has expired, is not 
yet valid, or is self-signed.
You can manage domains and IP addresses for bypass as follows:
●
To add items for certificate verification bypass, enter one or more domain names 
or IP addresses separated by commas, then click Add. IP addresses can also 
include the port number (for example 127.0.0.1:80). You cannot add IP address 
ranges.
●
To delete a domain name or IP address from the bypass list, select the item and 
click Delete. You can use the Ctrl and/or Shift keys to select multiple items for 
deletion.
Click Save when done.
Bypassing authentication decryption
If end users authenticate with either single sign-on or secure form-based 
authentication, web traffic is decrypted as part of the authentication process, 
regardless of whether SSL decryption is enabled in the policy. There may be some 
categories with privacy implications where you do not want this decryption to occur, 
for example financial data sites.
Important
We strongly recommend that you verify certificates for HTTPS sites. If you switch 
this option off, there is a chance of increased security risks from malicious sites with 
certificates that misrepresent their identity (for example, a site called gogle.com 
pretending to be Google).

Configuring Web Settings
86  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
Authentication decryption bypass also applies to traffic going through I Series 
appliances that is subject to any type of authentication.
To define a web category that is never decrypted during authentication on the SSL tab, 
under Authentication Decryption Bypass, select the category in the Available 
categories list, and click the > button to move it to the Selected categories list. 
Note the following for the selected categories:
●
The selections apply only to end users browsing from proxied connections. They 
do not apply to roaming users.
●
Users browsing these categories will be considered anonymous for both policy 
enforcement and reporting.
Configure Domain settings
Email domains can be used to enable end-users to self-register with the cloud service. 
Users with email addresses belonging to the domains that you add can create a 
password to self-register with the service. Domains can be configured at either the 
account level or policy level. Domains can be used to determine which policy users 
are assigned when they register.
Before reading this section, we recommend that you read Proxied connections, page 
161.
Permissions implications
Administrators who have permissions only for individual policies can access domain 
configuration only from within the policy, and they cannot amend account-level 
domains. They also receive a restricted set of controls when editing policy-level 
domains. From this view, they can see all domains but have editing rights only to the 
policy-level domains associated with their policy.
Note
The appliance does not currently support authentication decryption bypass for 
custom categories.

Legal requirements
Your terms and conditions for use of the service include a clause that restricts the use 
of domains to those that are legally registered to your organization. Bulk registering 
end users, page 174, explains the process of bulk registration, where the cloud service 
sends email to a list of email addresses uploaded to the service. The legal restriction is 
to prevent someone from maliciously or unintentionally spamming a third party with 
email originating from the cloud service.
 Policy-level domains
Policy-level domains are created in the policies themselves. Users with an email 
address in this domain are registered to the policy to which the domain is assigned. 
this is useful if you have users in your account with different email domains, who you 
wish to manage using different policies. 
To create a policy-level domain:
1.
Select Web > Policy Management > Policies.
2.
Click the name of the policy to open.
3.
Click the End Users tab.
4.
Under Self Registration, click Add. 
No policy-level domain can exist in multiple policies or accounts.
When you are adding a policy-level domain, some options are grayed out, because 
they are only applicable to account-level domains.
Account-level domains
Account-level domains can be added in order to allow users to self-register to any 
policy in your account. The actual policy they are assigned to is determined by the IP 
address from which they register (see Proxied connections, page 161). 
Account-level domains must have a default policy for remote users. Users registering 
with email addresses belonging to the domain, and connecting from unknown IP 
addresses, will be added to this default policy. If there is no default policy, then remote 
users cannot register and receive a error message when they try to do so.
Click Web > Settings > Domains to see the end-user registration domains, and the 
policy each domain is associated with. If they are account-level domains, the words 
“By connection” are shown instead of a policy name. 
Note
If all users within your account are on a single email domain and you have multiple 
policies, you must configure an account-level domain assigned to all policies.

Editing a domain
In the list of domains, click the name of a domain you want to edit, and then click 
Edit.
A domain can be associated with a specific policy or all policies. If you select 
Associate this domain with all policies, you are prompted to assign a default policy 
for remote users. If no account-level domains are assigned, remote users are registered 
into the policy associated with the account to which their domain is assigned.
If remote users try to register using an email address that is associated with an 
account-level domain and there is no default policy, they receive an error message.

Endpoint overview
Forcepoint Endpoint agents are lightweight software clients that run in the 
background on user devices, providing a seamless browsing experience for your end 
users. Endpoint agents automatically authenticate users with the service, and provide 
policy enforcement and data security features. The endpoint clients have been 
designed to consume minimal CPU, memory, and disk resources, and have tamper 
controls to prevent users disabling the software.
Note
Endpoint end user control is not supported for the Mac version of the Classic Proxy 
Connect Endpoint client.

Configuring Web Settings
90  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
The endpoint agents provide a User Principal Name (UPN) and an NTLM ID to 
identity end users. The cloud service uses this information to match users to the 
appropriate policy. The service first attempts to match the UPN. If no match is found, 
or if no UPN is available, the service attempts to find a user match using the NTLM 
ID.
Available endpoint agents are:
●
Neo: this endpoint agent can be used in either proxy connect mode or direct 
connect mode, and can automatically switch from one to the other when 
necessary. For customers who have also purchased Forcepoint Dynamic User 
Protection, Neo sends user activities there for analysis to compute the risk score. 
●
Proxy Connect: this classic endpoint agent redirects all traffic to the cloud proxy 
for analysis. Proxy Connect is recommended for most scenarios, and supports the 
widest set of security features.
●
Direct Connect: this classic endpoint agent contacts the cloud service for each 
request to determine whether to block or permit a website, but routes the web 
traffic itself directly to the Internet. Direct Connect also routes traffic to the cloud 
service to perform content analysis, if configured in your policy. Direct Connect is 
recommended for scenarios in which proxy connections may be problematic.
The differences between endpoint agents are further outlined below.
Neo
The Neo endpoint agent is a single agent that installs on the endpoint machine and 
includes both proxy connect and direct connect modes. Neo can automatically switch 
between the two modes depending on network conditions and performance. 
Once Neo is activated, full functionality of proxy connect or direct connect is 
available. Neo uses the appropriate endpoint mode, based on network conditions. 
When proxy connect mode is in use but cannot connect to the proxy or if performance 
becomes an issue, Neo will switch to the direct connect mode.
Neo collects activity data from the endpoint and, for customers who have purchased 
Forcepoint Dynamic User Protection, sends the data there where it is analyzed for the 
purpose of risk score calculation.
Proxy Connect (Classic)
The Proxy Connect endpoint redirects all traffic to the cloud proxy for analysis. 
Proxy Connect is ideal where proxy connections can be used without issue. This 
endpoint type supports the widest set of security features, such as data security 
scanning. Proxy Connect is regarded as the default option, and is recommended for 
most situations.
For more information on the current version, please see the Release Notes for 
Forcepoint Web Security Proxy Connect Endpoint, available in the portal on the 
Web > Endpoint > General page.

Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway Portal Help  91
Configuring Web Settings
Direct Connect (Classic)
The Direct Connect endpoint contacts the cloud service for each request, to 
determine whether to block or permit a website, but routes the web traffic itself 
directly to the Internet. Direct Connect also routes traffic to the cloud service to 
perform content analysis, if configured in your policy, and connects to the cloud 
service to retrieve its configuration settings.
Direct Connect endpoint is designed for use in situations where the use of proxy 
connections may be problematic. Direct Connect endpoint can improve the security 
and usability of the service in the following scenarios: 
●
Off-site (roaming) users for whom proxy connections may cause issues
●
In complex or changing network environments
●
In areas where geographic firewalls prohibit the use of proxies
●
When users need to access websites that do not work well with a proxy
●
When users need to use non-browser or custom applications that do not work well 
with a proxy
●
When geographically localized content is critical. 
For more information on feature support, see the Release Notes for Forcepoint Web 
Security Direct Connect Endpoint, available in the portal on the Web > Endpoint > 
General page.
Note
The Direct Connect endpoint is not suitable where data security features are 
required, since this requires all traffic to be directed to the cloud service.
Important
While the Direct Connect endpoint can provide improved security coverage in these 
scenarios, administrators should check that the networking requirements and level of 
feature support are acceptable for your intended deployment.

Endpoint connectivity
The following diagram illustrates the connectivity for Proxy Connect (through Neo or 
the Classic Proxy Connect endpoint) and Direct Connect (through Neo or the Cassic 
Direct Connect endpoint).
The diagram shows the two different endpoint versions servicing a web request:
1.
In the first scenario, Neo or the Classic Proxy Connect endpoint directs all web 
traffic via the cloud proxy. If the request is permitted, the proxy connects to the 
requested website and sends content back to the end-user client. (If the request is 
blocked, the user is shown a block page.)
2.
In the second scenario, a web request via Neo or the Classic Direct Connect 
endpoint consists of two stages:
a.
The endpoint connects to the cloud service to look up the user’s policy 
settings for the requested site.
b.
If the request is permitted, the client then redirects the request directly to the 
Internet. (If the request is blocked, the user is redirected to a block page.)
If required, you can deploy a combination of Proxy Connect and Direct Connect 
endpoints in your organization. However, only one classic endpoint instance (Classic 
Proxy Connect or Classic Directory Connect) can be installed on a client machine at 
any one time. The Neo endpoint agent includes both proxy connect and direct connect 
modes.
Note
Neo is regarded as the default option and is recommended for most situations.
If in doubt about which version is appropriate for your deployment, please consult 
the endpoint release notes, and/or contact Technical Support for advice.

Endpoint deployment options
Neo, Classic Proxy Connect, and Classic Direct Connect endpoint versions can be 
deployed on Windows and Mac operating systems (excluding iOS devices, such as 
iPhones, iPods, or iPads).
After configuring the endpoint client (as described in the next section), you have the 
following deployment options:
Windows operating system users
●
Download the endpoint installation file for Windows and:
■
Push it manually to selected client machines using your preferred distribution 
method - for example, Microsoft Group Policy Object (GPO).
■
(Classic Proxy Connect only) Allow users to download and install the 
endpoint software themselves from a link that you provide.
●
(Classic Proxy Connect only) Deploy the endpoint client to the end users in a web 
policy directly from the cloud. Each affected user is asked to install the endpoint 
software on their machine when they start a browsing session. See Endpoint tab.
Mac operating system users
●
Neo
■
Download the endpoint installation package for Mac. (Neo for Mac is only 
supported on macOS 11 (Big Sur).)
■
Deploy to individual client machines using mobile device management 
(MDM), such as Jamf, which distributes the installation package to a group of 
machines and performs the installation on that group.
●
Classic Proxy Connect and Direct Connect
■
Download the endpoint installation package for Mac on individual client 
machines and launch the installer by double-clicking the package.
■
Remotely install the endpoint client using MDM, such as Jamf, which 
distributes the installation package to a group of machines and performs the 
installation on that group. 
Users who do not install the endpoint client are authenticated according to the options 
specified on the Access Control tab for their policy. Single sign-on is used if 
configured; otherwise the cloud-based service falls back to NTLM identification or 
basic authentication. Users are prompted to install the endpoint software each time 
they start a browsing session, until they complete the installation process.

2.
Click Save.
If you do not select a default policy, any non-synchronized user is auto-generated in 
the cloud service with their NTLM ID as reported by the endpoint client. The newly-
created user becomes visible in the system within approximately 10 minutes. In the 
meantime, they are browsing anonymously and are reported as such.
Once the user is visible, you can assign them a different policy on the Account > 
Settings > End Users page, or assign them to groups on the Account > Settings > 
Groups page. Reports will also include the correct user information.

The endpoint client has a number of key protections against tampering, which should 
prevent the majority of end users from uninstalling or deleting it, even if they have 
local administrator rights:
Windows and Mac operating systems
●
Endpoint files and folders are protected from deletion and cannot be modified, 
moved, or renamed.
●
The endpoint process will automatically restart if it is stopped or killed.
●
A password is required to uninstall the endpoint client or stop the endpoint 
service.
Windows operating systems only
●
Endpoint registry settings cannot be modified or deleted.
●
The Service Control command to delete the endpoint service is blocked.
Download the endpoint client software
If you plan to deploy the endpoint client software manually, use the Endpoint Client

a location that blocks web traffic to the cloud service. This can introduce 
vulnerabilities, since it permits end users to circumvent the protections offered by the 
endpoint software.
To allow users to disable the endpoint client:
1.
Toggle End user control to ON.

Uninstall Endpoint
See Uninstalling the endpoint from the Mac (Classic Proxy Connect and 
Direct Connect), page 104.
Identifying Mac endpoint end users
When a Mac user is logged into an active directory-based domain, the endpoints 
identify users in the same way as for Windows operating system users. For Mac users 
not logged into a domain, however, the endpoint formats the user details in the cloud 
service as mac.local.[local_username]@[local_address]. 
For example, if you are logged in as “Joe Bloggs,” it might appear as 
mac.local.joebloggs@123-nosuchdomain.autoregistration.proxy. 
To search for all locally logged-on Mac users, do the following:
1.
Go to Account > Settings > End Users.
2.
In the Name field, enter “mac.local*”
3.
Click Search.
This brings up a list of all Mac users that are logged on locally.

Updating the endpoint 
Windows operating system users
For users with Windows operating systems, the Endpoint tab in your web policies 
includes an auto-update feature which can automatically deploy newer versions to 
browsers without desktop administrators getting involved. If you select this option, it 
applies to all users in the policy who have installed the endpoint client, regardless of 
whether it has been deployed via GPO or directly from the policy, assuming their 
browser supports deployment from the cloud. For more information, see Endpoint tab, 
page 170.
To deploy endpoint updates via GPO, first download the latest version from the 
Web > Settings > Endpoint page. The latest version appears at the top of the list of 
available downloads.
You can check which version of the endpoint client your end users have by running 
the Installed Endpoint Client Statistics report. 
Mac operating system users
For Mac operating system users, the endpoint client for the Mac can automatically 
deploy newer versions to browsers without involvement from desktop administrators.
Note
For Neo, automatic updates are enabled by default but can be configured on the Neo 
management portal, accessed from the Web > Settings > Endpoint page. For more 
information, see the Settings section of the Forcepoint Dynamic User Protection 
Help.

Endpoint bypass
 
If you have deployed the endpoint client to your end users, occasionally some 
applications do not work properly in conjunction with endpoint enforcement. This is 
more likely with the Proxy Connect endpoint and might affect, for example, custom-
designed applications for your organization.
If you are experiencing problems with applications on end users’ machines, use the 
Endpoint Bypass tab of the Web > Settings > Endpoint page to add the names of 
any applications that you want to bypass endpoint policy enforcement. For the Proxy 
Connect endpoint, this feature does not work for applications that use system browser 
settings to determine a proxy.

These custom categories can be used in the same way as the built-in categories; see 
Category list, page 196, for further information.
Use the toggle at the bottom of the page to Enable custom categories per policy. If 
this option is disabled, the Custom Categories tab is not available on the Web > Policy 
Management > Polices page and policy level custom categories cannot be added.
When this option is enabled, all policy level custom categories display by policy. 
Adding sites to custom categories
When adding sites to a custom category, you can add hostnames, IP addresses or 
address ranges, or URL paths. 
Hostnames
Enter hostnames without a protocol, for example: abc.com. This will match:
●
Any resource at the domain, using any protocol (for example http://abc.com, 
https://abc.com, ftp://abc.com).
●
Any subdomains of abc.com using any protocol, for example www.abc.com, 
123.abc.com, www.123.abc.com.
You can use a wildcard (*) within a hostname or at the beginning of a hostname. 
Wildcards at the beginning of a hostname match any hostname that ends with the 
string you enter, for example *abc.com matches 123abc.com, and any subdomains 
(for example www.123.abc.com, www.xxx.123abc.com).
A wildcard at the beginning of a hostname, followed by a dot (*.abc.com) matches 
any subdomains of abc.com (for example 123.abc.com), but not the abc.com domain 
itself.
Note
Certain characters have significance to the pattern matching mechanism, and should 
be preceded with a backslash (\). These characters are: [ ] { } \ + *
Note
Wildcards placed at the end of the string are removed.

URL paths
Any address with a slash (/) following the hostname or IP address is treated as a URL 
path (for example www.abc.com/, www.abc.com/mysite).
If you specify a URL path, it is treated as the start of a path, and matches anything 
beginning with the string you enter (for example, www.abc.com/mysite matches 
www.abc.com/mysite/folder/page.htm).
Note: URL paths will not match for HTTPS requests unless SSL decryption is being 
performed. For HTTPS requests, the full path is not provided to the proxy.
IP addresses
Enter IPv4 IP addresses or ranges in one of the following formats:
●
Explicit address: a single address. Example: 12.13.14.15
●
Explicit range: 2 addresses separated by a dash (-). Example: 12.13.14.15-
12.13.14.99 (a space before and after the dash is allowed, but not required)
●
Subnet: An address followed by a slash (/) and the number of bits, which is a 
number between 1 and 32. Example: 12.13.14.15/24
●
Subnet with subnet mask: an address followed by a slash (/) and a netmask. 
Example: 12.13.14.15/255.255.255.0
IP addresses and ranges are used to match the resolved address of a requested 
hostname, using any protocol and port.
Ports
If you include a port number that is the standard port number for the protocol being 
used (for example port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS), the port number is ignored 
and the entry is treated as described above. If the port number is a non-standard port 
for the protocol being used, the proxy will match only URLs that include the port 
number. 
For example, if you enter www.abc.com:8080/, then http://www.abc.com:8080/mysite 
will match, but http://www.abc.com/mysite will not. 
Important
If you have entered an IP address range, subnet, or subnet mask, be sure your entry 
does not have unintended impact. When a policy is applied, all addresses are 
handled the same way. For example, if the category is blocked, all qualifying 
addresses are blocked.

Time periods
The cloud service allows you to configure policies that restrict web surfing by time of 
day for either the whole policy or for website categories, users, and groups. When an 
exception rule is configured, it is applied to a time period. 
Use the Web > Policy Management > Time periods page to configure time periods 
for your account. These are configured at the account level so that they can be 
available for use in multiple policies, if required.
Each account is provided with 4 default time periods. 
To edit or view a time period
Click the name of a time period (for example, “Working hours”).
You can assign the time zone for the period, which is typically the default for the 
policy or connection where the users are located (see Proxied connections, page 161). 
The dark area defines the actual time period. Each division is a 15 minute period and 
can be set with either a single click or by clicking and dragging to produce a wider 
area. As you roll your mouse over the area, the absolute time is displayed below the 
time chart.
To define a new period
1.
Click Add time period.
2.
Enter a name and description for the new period.
3.
Choose a time zone. 
If you do not want to use the default for the policy or connection, you can select a

Key phrase content classifiers
The presence of a keyword or phrase (such as “Top Secret” or “Project X”) in a web

expression 
pattern.
Enter the regular expression for which you want the system to search, such 
as all 3-character strings followed by the sequence “123”. The expression 
should be compatible with Perl syntax. 
You can use alphanumeric characters and any of the following values: 
.     Any single character
[ ]   Any one character in the set
^     Beginning of line
[^]   Any one character not in the set
\s    White-space character
|     Or
\r?\n Line break
\     Escape special character
?     Previous expression exists or not
{ }   Range or frequency

\b    Word boundary
\x{hex-number}     Unicode character
\d    Digit character (0-9)
\D    Non-digit character
\w    Alphanumeric character
\W    Non-alphanumeric character
To include Unicode characters in your pattern, use the format \X{hex-
number}.
Do not use +, *, or {X,} without an upper limit. Instead use a limited 
quantifier such as {0,500}/{1,500}/{X,500}/{X}.When using a line 
break, use the exact syntax shown above.
For example: \b[a-zA-Z][347]\d{3}\bwill match strings (separated with 
word boundaries) starting with a letter followed by 3, 4 or 7 and then 3 
digits, like “c3122”.
Test
Because a regular expression pattern can be quite complex, it is important 
that you test the pattern before saving it. If improperly written, a pattern 
can create many false-positive incidents and slow down the system. 
Create a .txt file (less than 1 MB) that contains values that match this regex 
pattern. The file must be in plain text UTF8 format. 
Browse to the file and click Test to test the validity of your pattern syntax. 
If the pattern you entered is invalid, you’re given an opportunity to fix it. 
You cannot proceed until the test succeeds.

suspicious. 
●Weight - Select a weight, from -999 to 999 (excluding 0). When 
matched with a threshold, weight defines how many instances of 
a phrase can be present, in relation to other phrases, before 
triggering a policy. 
For example, if the threshold is 100 and a phrase’s weight is 10, a 
web post can have 9 instances of that phrase before a policy is 
triggered, provided no other phrases are matched. If phrase A has 
a weight of 10 and phrase B has a weight of 5, 5 instances of 
phrase A and 10 instances of phrase B will trigger the policy.
By default, if no weight is assigned, each phrase is given a weight 
of 1.
Thresholds are defined on the policy’s Data Security tab.

Configure general settings
1.
Use the toggle at the top of the page to indicate whether this appliance is used for 
filtering (ON, the default). When filtering is set to OFF, the appliance can 
communicate with the cloud service, but allows all web traffic to pass through 
unfiltered.
2.
Under General, enter a unique appliance Name (1 - 512 alphanumeric characters) 
and Description (up to 1024 characters).
3.
Select a Default policy for this appliance, and the Time zone used to apply policy 
settings.
You will have a chance to apply different policies to different internal networks 
managed by this appliance later.
4.
If you are using transparent NTLM identification and your appliance is not 
connected to a local Active Directory instance, enter the domain that forms part of 
your users’ NTLM identity. The NTLM domain is the first part of the 
domain\username with which users log on to their Windows PC; for example, 
MYDOMAIN\jsmith.

Select a time period after which a user’s login and password must be revalidated 
from the Session timeout drop-down list. The default is 1 day.
6.
Forward traffic to the cloud for advanced analysis is selected by default. This 
means that appropriate web traffic is redirected to the nearest cloud service cluster 
for additional analysis. Deselect this option if you do not want any traffic to be 
forwarded to the cloud. All traffic will be analyzed through the appliance, but 
without any cloud analytics.

Under Certificate Authority:
●
If you are adding a new appliance, use the drop-down list to indicate whether to 
Upload certificate files now, or Provide certificate later.
●
If you are editing an existing appliance, indicate whether to Use existing 
certificate files or Upload certificate files.
To upload the certificate files:
1.
Click Browse to navigate to the public certificate file, then click Open to populate 
the Public certificate field.
2.
Click Browse to navigate to the private key file, then click Open to populate the 
Private key field. The private key must be in either PEM or .key format.
3.
If you have chained certificates, click Browse and navigate to the intermediate 
certificate, then click Open to populate the Chained certificate field.
The certificate chain should include the root CA, and optionally additional 
intermediate CAs.
Generating an appliance certificate
Each appliance should have a valid X.509 version 3 identity certificate in PEM format 
with an unencrypted key. This certificate can be generated using a variety of tools. 
Below is a simple procedure using OpenSSL to generate a private key and CA that can 
be used for your appliance.
This section assumes that you are familiar with OpenSSL and have a working 
OpenSSL installation.
The following OpenSSL statement creates a 2048-bit RSA private key with a 
password of 1234:
Important
It is recommended that you define certificates when you add an appliance, in order 
to avoid browser warnings regarding SSL termination block, authentication, or 
quota/confirm operations. Some browsers, for example later versions of Chrome, 
may block the transaction and display an error message.
Be sure to:
1.
Generate a CA certificate. Each appliance should have a valid X.509 identity 
certificate with an unencrypted key. This certificate can be generated using a 
variety of tools, for example OpenSSL. For details and an example, see 
Generating an appliance certificate, page 148. 
2.
Import this certificate to all relevant browsers.
3.
Upload this certificate to each appliance as described below.
To use the cloud service SSL decryption feature, you should also install the 
Forcepoint root certificate on each client machine. See Enabling SSL decryption, 
page 185, for details.

Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway Portal Help  149
Managing Network Devices
openssl genrsa -passout pass:1234 -des3 -out 
CA_key_password.pem 2048
You must supply a password, as OpenSSL does not allow the creation of a private key 
without one. You can then strip the password from the key as follows:
openssl rsa -in CA_key_password.pem -passin pass:1234 -out 
CA_key.pem
This also renames the private key file from CA_key_password.pem to CA_key.pem.
Finally, use the following statement to create the CA:
openssl req -x509 -days 11000 -new -sha1 -key CA_key.pem -
out CA_cert.pem
Note that this command prompts you to input information about different parameters, 
such as country, state, locality, or your organization’s name. 
Once you have created the private key (CA_key.pem) and public certificate 
(CA_cert.pem), import the certificate to all relevant browsers, and upload the 
certificate to each appliance using the Certificates tab.

2.
Enter a policy name and administrator email address. This email address is used 
as the address from which system messages are sent. Your users may occasionally 
reply to these messages, so this should be an email address that is monitored by 
your IT staff or administrative contact.
3.
Select the template you want to use for your policy. This can be one of the 
following:
■
A predefined template that determines which URL categories are blocked and 
which are permitted for a policy:
○
Default blocks a standard set of categories, including categories relating 
to adult material, drugs, violence, productivity, and security.
○
Basic blocks the most frequently blocked categories and permits the rest.
○
Basic Security blocks only categories considered to be a security risk. 
○
Monitor Only permits all categories.
You can further refine how web traffic is managed changing the actions for 
individual categories on the Web Categories tab, page 185.
All other policy settings are as defined in Standard Web Configuration, page

for your end users, such as including a user name or user agent header.
To run the test:
1.
Under Filtering Test, enter the full URL that you want to test, including the http:// 
or https:// prefix.
2.
Optionally, enter the email address of an end user registered or synchronized with 
your account.
3.
Specify the Egress point for the test. By default this is the current IP address that 
you have used to access the cloud portal. You can also use:
■
Other IP to specify a different IP address that is registered as a proxied 
connection in one of your policies
■
Unknown IP to test a roaming user scenario
■
Edge device or Appliance to test connections forwarded to the cloud by an 
on-premises network device
If you have defined internal networks for your network device, you can 
optionally also specify the internal IP address that you want to test.

Uploading a policy assignment file
You can automatically assign end users to policies by uploading a file of policy and 
user information to the cloud service.
Format the CSV file as two columns, with a header row consisting of the words 
“EmailAddress” and “Policy”. The two columns must contain:
●
An email address belonging to an existing user in your account
●
A policy name in your account.
For example:
EmailAddress,Policy
address1@domain1.com,Default
address2@domain1.com,Sales Policy
Note that you do not have to include all of your existing users in the file, only those 
whose policy assignment you wish to change. If a field contains a comma, it must be 
quoted. 
To upload the file: 
1.
Under Policy Assignment, browse to the file that you wish to use.
2.
Click Upload.
The email addresses in the file are checked against the existing users in the account, 
and a confirmation message is displayed once the file has uploaded successfully. If 
there are errors in the file—for example, incorrect formatting, a non-existent policy 
name, or an invalid, unknown, or duplicate email address—the upload is canceled and

Policy name
The name of the policy, which you may want to rename from Default to something 
more meaningful to your organization, especially if you have a requirement for 
multiple policies. 
Administrator email
This is the email address for the web administrator of this policy. This email address is 
used as the address from which system messages are sent. Your users may 
occasionally reply to these messages, so this should be an email address that is 
monitored by your IT staff or administrative contact.
Default and alternate PAC file address
The default PAC file address is the policy-specific PAC file for this policy. The 
alternative PAC file address can be used for remote user requests from a network that 
has port 8081, 8082 or 8087 locked down. 
See Policy-specific PAC file for further details.
Time zone
To use time-based web filtering, the cloud service must first determine the time zone 
where users are located. The time zone you set can be used as a single zone for the 
whole policy, or you can set up time zones for one or more of your proxied 
connections that override the time zone on the General tab (see Proxied connections, 
page 161).
Daylight saving time is supported where valid on all time zones except GMT and 
UTC, which are static.
Note
If you have already deployed a policy-specific PAC file that uses a different URL 
than the one displayed on this page, there is no need to change it unless you wish to. 
PAC file URLs provided with earlier versions of your cloud web product will 
continue to work.

Internet availability
Use this option to configure time-based policy enforcement. The default setting is to 
allow Internet access at all times, although you can apply user and group-based 
exceptions (see User and group exceptions for time-based access control, page 160).
Alternatively, you can restrict all access by time and display an appropriate block page 
when access is unavailable. There are 2 formats for this:
1.
Block access for the duration of a defined period (for example, during working 
hours).
2.
Block access outside a defined period (for example, allowing users to access the 
Internet only during their lunch period).
The drop-down list contains the standard time periods and any custom periods you 
have set up (see Time periods).
Full traffic logging
When you enable full traffic logging for your account, all web policies inherit the 
default setting that you configure. If you want to override the default log retention for 
a particular policy, change the selection in the Full traffic logging drop-down list from 
Use account default to either Enabled or Disabled.

A Daily quota applies to all users accessing categories with Quota as the filtering 
action or exception. Enter the daily limit in minutes (default 60) for all users of 
this policy. Then define the session length in minutes (default 10) during which 
users can visit sites in quota-limited categories.
●
A Per-category quota allows you to specify a daily limit per category and a 
session length per category that applies to all quota-limited categories by 
default. You can then change the daily quota time settings for particular categories 
or filtering exceptions on the Web Categories tab. See Managing categories, 
actions, and SSL decryption, page 186.
A session begins when the user clicks the Use Quota Time button.
The daily quota allocation for users within a policy is refreshed at midnight in the time 
zone defined for the user’s proxied connection. If no specific time zones are defined in 
either the proxied connection or the policy, the quota allocation is refreshed at 
midnight UTC.
If you change the total quota time or session time after a user has started to use their 
daily quota or has received the quota block page from the cloud-based service, the 
changes will not take effect until the next day. Similarly, if you move a user to a 
different policy after they have started to use their daily quota or has received the 
quota block page from the cloud-based service, the change does not take effect until 
the next day.
Search filtering
Search filtering is a feature offered by some search engines that helps to limit the 
number of inappropriate search results displayed to users.
To activate this option, select Enable search filtering. 
Ordinarily, Internet search engine results may include thumbnail images associated 
with sites matching the search criteria. If those thumbnails are associated with blocked 
sites, the cloud service prevents users from accessing the full site, but does not prevent 
the search engine from displaying the image.
When you enable search filtering, the cloud service activates a search engine feature 
that stops thumbnail images associated with blocked sites from being displayed in 
search results. Enabling search filtering affects both local and roaming users.

●
Destination domains and IP addresses that users assigned this policy can access 
without going through the cloud service (see Proxy bypass, page 163)
Proxied connections
Most organizations have at least one proxied connection configured per policy. The 
proxied connection address is used to identify traffic from your organization’s egress 
IP address and, by default, apply the policy to that traffic. 
Proxied connections:
●
Are public-facing IP addresses, IP address ranges, or IP subnets for offices in your 
organization using the cloud service.
●
Are often the external address of your Network Address Translation (NAT) 
firewall.
●
May be appliances or edge devices configured on the Web > Settings > Network 
Devices page.
●
Could include branch offices, remote sites, or satellite campuses.
Proxied connections are NOT:
●
IP addresses of individual client machines.
●
IP addresses outside your organization.

Defining Web Policies
162  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
If you have several points of presence on the Internet, you can combine all of these 
under one policy, or have separate policies for each public-facing IP address.
To add a proxied connection:
1.
Click Add under the Proxied Connections table.
2.
In the Add Proxied Connection dialog box, enter a unique Name and helpful 
Description for the connection.
3.
Specify the connection Type, then enter the Address (single IP address), Subnet, 
or Range.
4.
Select the Time zone for this connection.
If you have a single policy for multiple Internet gateways in different countries, 
you may want to set each to a different time zone. If all connections are in the 
same time zone, it is easier to set the time zone for the complete policy (see Time 
zone) and select the “use policy time zone” option.
Daylight saving time is supported where valid on all time zones except GMT and 
UTC, which are static.
5.
Optionally, mark the Override Google redirect behavior checkbox, then 
determine which override option to use.
By default, Google redirects browsers to the appropriate site for the country it 
detects (for example, google.fr for France). Sometimes this is not accurate (for 
example, if end users browse through a cloud proxy in a different country).
The Google redirect setting for the connection takes precedence over the setting 
for the policy (see User and group exceptions for time-based access control, page 
160). If you do not configure Google settings for the connection, the policy-level, 
if any, are used.
This feature requires that you enable SSL decryption for the Search Engines and 
Portals category on the Web Categories tab (see Managing categories, actions, 
and SSL decryption, page 186), and install the Forcepoint root certificate on end 
user machines. If you mark the checkbox without enabling SSL decryption, a 
warning appears.
The available options are:
■
Ensure requests for google.com are not redirected, which prevents Google 
from redirecting to a local country site when the end user enters “google.com”
■
Redirect requests for google.com to, which ensures all google.com requests 
are redirected to a local country site of your choice. Enter the country code in 
the text field (for example, fr for google.fr, or co.uk for google.co.uk).
6.
Click Continue to save your change and return to the Connections tab.
Note
If you do not add any proxied connections to the policy, all users are treated as 
remote and must authenticate to use the service. In this case, the policy they use is 
determined by their email domain. They see a service-wide Remote User Welcome 
page that is not configurable. Once logged on, they are served configurable 
notification pages from the customer account.

Proxy bypass
Proxy bypass sites are destinations that users can access either directly, or through an 
alternate (third-party) proxy, without going through the cloud service. For example, 
organizational webmail sites and system traffic, like Microsoft and antivirus updates, 
should be added to the bypass list.
●
For users with the Neo or Direct Connect endpoint, bypass destinations are not 
analyzed by the cloud service.
●
For users whose traffic is sent to the cloud service via PAC file, including users of 
the Proxy Connect endpoint, bypass destinations are added to the policy PAC file.

Access Control tab
Use the Access Control tab to configure how your end users are identified by the 
cloud service. You can configure multiple authentication or identification options for 
your users if required.
The cloud service works “out of the box” for many organizations. A single policy 
applied to an organization’s web traffic provides protection from malware and 
inappropriate content. However, most customers want to tailor the service to align it 
with their Internet acceptable use policy, which may require granular configuration on 
a per-user and per-group basis, with different users or groups assigned to specific 
policies. Often, organizations want to report on the surfing habits of their employees. 
These use cases require the service to identify specific users in order to apply the 
correct policy, and to log user actions for reporting purposes. 
There are a number of events that can lead to an end user being asked to authenticate:
●
The user is connecting from an IP address configured as a proxied connection in 
one of your policies, and the policy has the Always authenticate users option 
enabled on the Access Control tab.
●
The user is accessing a website within a category that has an action of Require 
user authentication. You configure this within the category itself.
●
The user is attempting to access a website for which there is a group or user 
exception. At this point, the cloud service needs to find out who the user is in 
order to determine whether the exception applies.
●
The end user connects from an unknown IP address, so is considered a remote 
user.
When a request is made from an unknown IP address, users are served a 
notification page asking them to authenticate. Because the cloud service does not 
know who the users are at this time, the notification page is a generic service-wide 
page. See Roaming home page for further information.
To configure user authentication:
1.
Under Authentication Settings, define when to authenticate.

Note
If user authentication is required by a connection-based policy, the service checks 
whether the user is assigned to a specific policy, and applies the user’s policy. The 
user’s “home” policy overrides the IP-based policy for enforcement actions.

Select Always authenticate users on first access to force all users of this 
policy (whose source IP address or appliance is configured on the 
Connections tab) to identify or authenticate themselves to proceed. If they do 
not, they are unable to use the cloud service.
■
Select Only authenticate when if you want to use authentication only if 
either of the following is true:
○
Users are accessing the web from an unknown IP address.
In this case, if web endpoint software or single sign-on is not available, 
the user receives the service-wide Welcome page. Users must log on to 
allow the correct policy to be applied. 
○
The requested site is in a category or has a user or group exception that 
requires authentication.
2.
Select the authentication methods you wish to use.
If you do not select any authentication methods, when users try to access a 
website, they are presented with a basic authentication dialog into which they 
must enter their cloud logon credentials to proceed.
The cloud service provides the following options for identifying end users 
transparently:
■
Select Endpoint to use web endpoint software, which is installed on client 
machines to provide transparent authentication, enforce use of web policies, 
and pass authentication details to the cloud-based service. See Configure 
Endpoint settings.
■
Select Single sign-on to use clientless transparent authentication via a 
supported identity provider. See Configure End User Single Sign-On settings.
If you do not deploy web endpoint software or use single sign-on, the cloud 
service can use one of the following methods to identify users transparently or 
manually when they connect to the Internet.
■
Select NTLM transparent identification to identify users in this policy with 
their NTLM credentials. Then, select the NTLM registration page or use the 
default setting. See NTLM identification, page 167, and NTLM registration 
page, page 167.
NTLM transparent identification is also used as a fallback if either the web 
endpoint or single sign-on fails. 
■
Select Secure form-based authentication to display a logon form to the end 
user. When the user enters their cloud credentials, they are sent over a secure 
connection for authentication.
If the users have not previously registered to use the service, they can do so by 
clicking Register. This takes them into the registration process. See End 
Users tab, page 173 for further details.
Note
NTLM transparent identification is not valid for remote users (connecting from 
unknown IP addresses). Such users must always authenticate with the web endpoint, 
single sign-on, or a valid email address and password.

Pre-logon welcome page
When you select Welcome page (where client software supports it), a configurable 
welcome page is presented to end users prior to the basic authentication dialog box, if 
their browser supports it. You can specify a single page that is presented for 
connection requests or different pages for requests using HTTP. The default pages 
provide three buttons: Log in, Register, and Forgotten your password?
●
Log in: To continue, users click Log in and are presented with the basic 
authentication dialogue.

do so by clicking Register. This takes them into the registration process. See End 
Users tab, page 173 for further details.
●
Forgotten your password?: If users cannot remember their password, they can 
click Forgotten your password? They are redirected to a web page where they 
enter their email address. An email is sent containing a link to the cloud service, 
where they must create a new password before being allowed to continue to 
authenticate.
As with all notification pages, you can tailor the default to meet your needs and use it 
to remind your users that they are using company resources that are governed by an 
acceptable use policy. In addition, you can select the option to display a notice to your 
users that asks them to agree to accept the terms of your acceptable use policy if they 
wish to continue browsing. See Acceptable use policy, page 159.
Session timeout
Users’ credentials for single sign-on and secure form-based authentication are not sent 
every browser session. However, the credentials must be revalidated periodically for 
security reasons, and you define the time period for that revalidation under Session

Once the selected period has elapsed after a user’s credentials were last validated, the 
user is either re-authenticated transparently through your identity provider, or asked to 
supply their logon credentials again for form-based authentication.
NTLM identification
Select NTLM transparent identification where possible to use the Windows NT 
and LAN Manager authentication protocol (NTLM) identification for all users of this 
policy except those whose user agent types are known not to support it—for example, 
Firefox on Linux. Non-supported user agents are presented with the pre-login 
welcome page, and users can log on using the basic authentication mechanism.
NTLM registration page
 
Users of policies where NTLM is selected must undergo an additional, once only, 
registration task to associate their NTLM credentials with their registered cloud 
credentials. See NTLM transparent identification, page 177 for further information. 
As with all notification pages, you can use the default page, customize it, or create 
your own.

NTLM identity
The NTLM identity is the domain\username with which users log on to their Windows 
PC; for example, MYDOMAIN\jsmith.
NTLM credentials
NTLM credentials include the NTLM identity (as defined above), the PC’s identity, 
and a non-reversible encryption of the user’s password. These are sent by the browser 
when a server (in this case a cloud service proxy) sends an NTLM challenge.
NTLM security implications
There are a number of security implications associated with the use of NTLM in the 
cloud service. These are discussed below.
The NTLM credentials are being passed across an unsecure Internet 
connection
NTLM is a secure protocol that does not carry the user’s password, but a 
cryptographic hash of the password. To authenticate a user by validating a password 
hash, a network service must know the user’s password. The cloud service is outside 
of the company network, and so does not know the user’s network password. For this 
reason, the cloud service can use NTLM only to identify users, not to authenticate 
them. This limitation helps to preserve the security of the user’s network passwords.
Transparent identification compared to basic authentication
Because NTLM does not require the user to actually authenticate with the cloud 
service by entering a password, one might argue that it is less secure than basic 
authentication. This is not the case. Most cloud service users save their usernames and 
passwords in their browsers and therefore, if someone wanted to surf the Internet as 
another user, they can do so if they can access that user’s PC. This is exactly the same 
situation as NTLM. To protect against this, in both cases, and with any product that 
provides web filtering, you should consider physical security and keyboard locking 
when users leave their desks to keep the network secure.
Limitations
1.
Transparent identification does not authenticate; for example, it does not do 
password checking. It relies on the customer site having secure NT or Active 
Directory domains set up, along with physical security to stop unauthorized 
access to the company network or the users’ computers.
Note
Although NTLM Identification works with Windows workgroups, it is not a 
recommended solution if you are concerned about security and correctly identifying 
end users.

Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway Portal Help  169
Defining Web Policies
2.
You cannot use transparent identification for remote users. Remote users must be 
registered and must log on using their email addresses.
3.
Users of non-Windows systems in a transparent identification policy still have to 
log on manually.
4.
Many proxies do not pass NTLM challenges, so if you have a chained proxy 
deployment, you should check this. Microsoft ISA/TMG Server and Blue Coat 
ProxySG do support NTLM pass-through.
5.
A browser that supports NTLM but is operating in a non-Windows environment 
(e.g., Firefox on a Linux platform), may exhibit strange behavior and may not 
work with a cloud policy that is configured to use NTLM. Where possible, we 
attempt to identify such browsers by user agent type and send an authentication 
request rather than an NTLM challenge.
6.
The existing Welcome page is not shown to users of NTLM-capable browsers in a 
transparent identification policy.
How NTLM works once users are fully configured
Fully configured means that users are registered with the cloud service and their 
NTLM identities are known. See End Users tab, page 173, for details on registering 
users, and NTLM transparent identification, page 177, for details on NTLM identity.
1.
Users start their browsers and try to visit a website.
2.
The cloud service checks the users’ source IP address and applies the correct 
policy.
3.
The cloud service finds that transparent identification is enabled in the policy and 
initiates the NTLM conversation, during which the browser sends the NTLM 
credentials with no involvement of the users. Note that it is the local policy (i.e., 
the one identified by IP address) that determines whether NTLM is to be used. 
4.
The cloud service finds the users’ information in the policy by looking up the 
NTLM identity, and marks this connection as identified.
5.
The cloud service processes the original request as normal.
This all happens transparently, behind the scenes.
Setting authentication options for specific users
If you wish to enforce specific authentication options for certain end users, overriding 
the authentication settings defined in the policy, you can do this via a setting in the 
user’s PAC file URL. For those users who need to use a specific authentication 
mechanism, deploy a PAC file URL using the “a=” switch, in the following format:
http://webdefence.global.blackspider.com:8082/proxy.pac?a=X

Defining Web Policies
170  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
The a= parameter controls the authentication option used, where X can be one of the 
following:
For further details about PAC files, see Proxy auto-configuration (PAC).
Endpoint tab
 
Use the Endpoint tab to enable secure transparent authentication with the web 
endpoint for end users whose requests are managed by this policy. 
The cloud service uses the User Principal Name (UPN) or the NTLM ID provided by 
the endpoint agent to match endpoint users to the appropriate policy. The service first 
attempts to match the UPN. If no match is found, or if no UPN is available, the service 
attempts to find a user match using the NTLM ID.
From this tab you can deploy the Proxy Connect endpoint to either the roaming users 
or all users in the policy directly from the cloud. (The Direct Connect endpoint and 
Neo must be installed manually; automatic installation from this tab is not supported.)
●
Proxy Connect users in your network will be asked to install the endpoint software 
on their machine when they start a browsing session.
●
Roaming users must first authenticate themselves via the Roaming home page 
before being asked to install the endpoint software.
See this Knowledge Base article for a list of browsers that support Proxy Connect 
endpoint deployment directly from the cloud.
Parameter
Description
a=n
NTLM identification is used. If NTLM is not supported

For Neo, Proxy Connect, and Direct Connect endpoint software, you can push the 
endpoint manually to selected client machines using your preferred distribution 
method. For more information, see Configure Endpoint settings.
For both classic Direct Connect and Proxy Connect endpoint clients, you can choose 
to automatically update endpoint whenever a new version is released. Note that if you 
select an automatic update option, it applies to all users in the policy who have 
installed the endpoint on the selected operating system, regardless of how the endpoint 
software was originally deployed.
For Neo, automatic updates are enabled by default but can be configured on the Neo

Endpoint PAC Control
By default, Neo and Proxy Connect endpoint clients retrieve the cloud service PAC 
file and use it to determine which websites should be accessed through the cloud 
proxy, and which port to use for web browsing. 
Use the settings in the Endpoint PAC Control section to determine which PAC file 
URL Endpoint should access for users in this policy. 
The options are:
●
Use default PAC file URL...: retrieves the PAC file over port 8082 (or 8087 for 
HTTPS). Web browsing is performed via port 8081.
●
Use alternate PAC file URL...: retrieves the PAC file over port 80 (or port 443 
for HTTPS). Web browsing is also performed via ports 80 or 443. Use this option 
for locations where ports 8081 and 8082/8087 are locked down. 
For more information on the default and alternate PAC file URLs, see Proxy auto-
configuration (PAC). 
Select Retrieve PAC file over HTTPS to download PAC files over a secure (HTTPS) 
connection. For more information on this setting, see Accessing PAC files over 
HTTPS.
Classic Endpoint installation
To configure web endpoint software installation:
1.
If you want to deploy the Proxy Connect endpoint client automatically, mark the 
Deploy endpoint software on user machines... checkbox.
This setting defines whether the endpoint is deployed to the end users in this 
policy. If you clear this option at a later date, there will be no further new 
deployments of the endpoint. However, the installed endpoint software will 
continue to work unless it is uninstalled from the client machines.
2.
Choose whether the Proxy Connect endpoint is deployed to all cloud end users, or 
only to roaming users.
3.
To ensure that your endpoint client software always uses the latest version, mark 
one or more automatic update check boxes. 
If you clear these options at a later date, there will be no further automatic updates 
of existing installations, although the installed endpoints will continue to work. 
Note
These settings only apply to the Proxy Connect endpoint. The Retrieve PAC file 
over HTTPS option requires build 2826 or later. Earlier versions of the Proxy 
Connect endpoint will always download the PAC file over HTTP, and are not 
affected by this setting. Ensure that your Endpoint clients have connectivity to a 
Forcepoint point of presence (data center or local PoP) on TCP ports 8087 or 443, as 
appropriate, before enabling this option.

4.
Define which PAC file URL the Proxy Connect endpoint should use, and whether 
to retrieve the PAC file via a secure (HTTPS) connection. 
Use the alternate PAC file address for locations where non-standard ports are 
locked down (see Endpoint PAC Control, page 172).
5.
Under Classic Endpoint Installation Screen, you can provide a customized 
message that appears to end users on Windows machines at the beginning of the 
Proxy Connect endpoint download and installation process.
The message can be used to reassure the user that the download is company-
approved, and to provide any further information they may need. To customize the 
message, enter the message you want to display in the Branding text field.

End Users tab
 
The End Users tab is where all end-user registration configuration is performed. 
Registration is the method of getting user credentials into your cloud service account.
There are currently 3 methods of registering end users:
1.
Registering by invitation
2.
Bulk registering end users
3.
End user self-registration
For (2) and (3) above, you must enter the email domains where the users’ email 
addresses reside into the account or policy. See Configure Domain settings for further 
information. For (1), users do not need an email address within your configured 
domains.
If you have chosen to use the identity management feature to synchronize your user 
and group data with the cloud as described in Working with External Directories, you 
do not need to register end users at all. You can synchronize your organization’s users 
with the cloud service instead. When you synchronize, users are automatically 
registered with the cloud-based service. (They only need to self-register when they 
travel.) 
Directory synchronization can include NTLM IDs. You can then enable NTLM 
identification on the Access Control tab. This allows your users to use the service 
immediately after synchronization, without their having to perform any self-

registration actions or manual logon. If you enable NTLM identification but for some 
reason do not synchronize NTLM IDs from your directory, your users are required to 
complete the self-registration process, and then perform a second registration 
operation to associate their NTLM ID with their user account on the service. (See 
NTLM transparent identification, page 177, for more information.)
If you don’t want to use NTLM identification, you can configure the service to send 
invitations to all newly synchronized users. They can then complete self-registration 
process and log on using email address (or name) and password.
Through the Directory Synchronization feature (not supported by SCIM), you have 
the option to notify new users that they are protected by the cloud-based service when 
they surf the web.
If System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) has been configured for 
identity management users can use the service immediately after synchronizing user 
information with your identity provider, without first having to perform self-
registration. Note, however, that it can take a number of minutes before all new 
information is propagated to policies 
 Registering by invitation
There may be users that you want to use your policy who do not have an email address 
within your email domains; for example consultants or contractors working at your 
location that you want to be bound by your Internet usage policy. You can invite these 
users to use the policy by selecting Invite an End User from the End Users tab.
Once you have added the end users’ names, email addresses, and if available NTLM 
identification, the cloud service sends them the registration email in the same way as if 
they had self registered. They click on the link and are asked to enter their password.
Bulk registering end users
Bulk end-user registration simplifies the self-registration process by reducing it from 
2 steps to 1. Rather than the end users visiting the portal and entering their names and 
email addresses into a form, you upload their names and email addresses in bulk, and 
the cloud service automatically dispatches them email. The users can then register at 
stage 2, where they click a link in the email they receive and enter their password into 
the portal.

register, or are bulk registered.
For non-directory users, the following process occurs one time:
1.
The users start their browsers and try to visit a website.
2.
The cloud service checks the users’ source IP address and applies the correct 
policy.
3.
The cloud service finds that transparent identification is enabled in the policy and 
initiates the NTLM conversation, during which the browsers send the NTLM 
credentials with no involvement of the users.
4.
The cloud service fails to find the users’ NTLM information in the policy.
5.
The cloud service displays the NTLM registration page.
6.
The users, if already registered, enter their email addresses and passwords and 
submit the form. If they are not already registered, they can click Register, also on 
this page, and are taken through the standard end-user self-registration process.
7.
The cloud service validates the usernames and passwords that are entered. If the 
validation fails, it re-displays the form.
8.
If the validation succeeds, the cloud service records the previously received 
NTLM identity against this user, and marks this connection as being identified.
Request processing continues as for a fully configured user.
Editing end-user registration pages
You can edit all end-user registration pages and the registration message to suit your 
requirements. The default pages include instructions to help users understand the 
process but these are limited for ease of editing.
Managing registered users
You can search the list of end users who are registering or have registered by clicking 
the link where the number of registered users is reported on the End Users tab. This 
page is the same as the account-level end users page, except that it applies changes at 
the policy-level. 
From the search results page, you can select an individual user and modify his or her 
details. You can change a user’s name (but not email address, because that uniquely 
identifies the user), delete the user, or block the user from accessing the service. Note 
that the service’s self-registration feature means that deleting a user does not prevent

Add hostnames, IP addresses, IP address ranges, or URL paths. For detailed 
guidance on how to enter sites, and how entries are interpreted, see Adding sites to 
custom categories, page 183. Note the following general guidance:
■
Ensure that hostnames are added only once.
■
Protocols (for example “http://”, “ftp://”) are ignored. Entries are matched to 
all protocols.
■
Standard ports for the protocol being used are ignored (for example, ports 80 
for HTTP, and 443 for HTTPS).

Use the buttons at the bottom of the page to Download sites to or Upload sites from a

Adding sites to custom categories
When adding sites to a custom category, you can add hostnames, IP addresses or 
address ranges, or URL paths. 
Hostnames
Enter hostnames without a protocol, for example: abc.com. This will match:
●
Any resource at the domain, using any protocol (for example http://abc.com, 
https://abc.com, ftp://abc.com).
●
Any subdomains of abc.com using any protocol, for example www.abc.com, 
123.abc.com, www.123.abc.com.
You can use a wildcard (*) within a hostname or at the beginning of a hostname. 
Wildcards at the beginning of a hostname match any hostname that ends with the 
string you enter, for example *abc.com matches 123abc.com, and any subdomains 
(for example www.123.abc.com, www.xxx.123abc.com).
Important
When a file is uploaded, the contents of the file will 
replace the list of sites previously associated with the 
category. It will not add to that list.
Note
Certain characters have significance to the pattern matching mechanism, and should 
be preceded with a backslash (\). These characters are: [ ] { } \ + *

Defining Web Policies
184  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
A wildcard at the beginning of a hostname, followed by a dot (*.abc.com) matches 
any subdomains of abc.com (for example 123.abc.com), but not the abc.com domain 
itself.
URL paths
Any address with a slash (/) following the hostname or IP address is treated as a URL 
path (for example www.abc.com/, www.abc.com/mysite).
If you specify a URL path, it is treated as the start of a path, and matches anything 
beginning with the string you enter (for example, www.abc.com/mysite matches 
www.abc.com/mysite/folder/page.htm).
Note: URL paths will not match for HTTPS requests unless SSL decryption is being 
performed. For HTTPS requests, the full path is not provided to the proxy.
IP addresses
Enter IPv4 IP addresses or ranges in one of the following formats:
●
Explicit address: a single address. Example: 12.13.14.15
●
Explicit range: 2 addresses separated by a dash (-). Example: 12.13.14.15-
12.13.14.99 (a space before and after the dash is allowed, but not required)
●
Subnet: An address followed by a slash (/) and the number of bits, which is a 
number between 1 and 32. Example: 12.13.14.15/24
●
Subnet with subnet mask: an address followed by a slash (/) and a netmask. 
Example: 12.13.14.15/255.255.255.0
IP addresses and ranges are used to match the resolved address of a requested 
hostname, using any protocol and port.
Ports
If you include a port number that is the standard port number for the protocol being 
used (for example port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS), the port number is ignored 
and the entry is treated as described above. If the port number is a non-standard port 
for the protocol being used, the proxy will match only URLs that include the port 
number. 
For example, if you enter www.abc.com:8080/, then http://www.abc.com:8080/mysite 
will match, but http://www.abc.com/mysite will not. 
Note
Wildcards placed at the end of the string are removed.

Enabling SSL decryption
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the industry standard for transmitting secure data over

enables the cloud proxy to serve the correct notification page to the user. For example, 
a block page if the SSL site is in a category that the end user is prevented from 
accessing, or the Pre-logon welcome page, page 166, for authentication.
To implement SSL decryption for your end users, you need a root certificate on each 
client machine that acts as a Certificate Authority for SSL requests to the cloud proxy. 
To install the root certificate for your end users and enable notification pages for SSL 
sites:
1.
On the Web Categories tab, click the root certificate link and download the 
certificate to a location on your network. You can then deploy the certificate 
manually, using your preferred distribution method 
2.
Once the certificate has been deployed, return to this page and toggle the SSL 
decryption switch to ON.

Click Save.
Managing categories, actions, and SSL decryption
The category list on the Web Categories tab includes the standard categories 
provided with your subscription, and any custom categories that you have defined on 
the Custom Categories tab for this policy (shown as Policy Custom Categories) or on 
the Policy Management > Custom Categories page (shown as Account Custom 
Categories). 
●
 Actions (described in Policy enforcement actions, page 188) are applied to either 
standard or custom categories to determine whether and how end users are 
allowed to access websites in the category.

In the Standard Categories section, child categories are indented under their parent 
categories. Expand the parent category to see its child categories.
Parent categories allow specific categories to be grouped by a more generic 
description—for example, Internet Communication is the parent category for 
General Email, Organizational Email, Text and Media Messaging, and Web 
Chat. However, there is no hierarchical relationship between parent categories and the 
child categories within them: you can set a filtering action for a parent category 
without it affecting the child category, and vice versa.
Privacy categories are marked with a padlock icon. This predefined group includes 
the following categories that may be subject to regulatory requirements:
●
Financial Data and Services
●
Prescribed Medications
●
Education
●
Government
●
Health
Websites in these categories may include personal identification information that 
should not be decrypted, and you may want to avoid specifying these sites for 
decryption.

Policy enforcement actions
Each category has an action assigned to it. This is the action that the cloud service 
takes in response to a user’s Internet request. The action applies to all users of this 
policy unless exceptions are configured.
The available actions are:
●
Allow access
Allow access means that any website within the category is always accessible, 
regardless of whether it exists in another category that has the Block access 
action.
●
Do not block
If you do not want websites to be blocked, select Do not block. This ensures that 
the site is not blocked under this rule, but if it also exists in another category that 
has an action of Block access, it is blocked under that category.
●
Require user authentication
This action allows you to monitor who is accessing sites in this category. If you 
are forcing users to be identified or authenticate themselves, it has the same 
impact as Do not block. If the users are not already identified or authenticated, 
they are forced to do so to access the site. If the site also exists in a category that 
has the action Allow access, the users are not forced to identify or authenticate 
themselves.
●
Confirm
Users receive a block page, asking them to confirm that the site is being accessed 
for business purposes. Clicking Continue enables the user to view the site.
Clicking Continue starts a timer. During the time period that you configure (10 
minutes by default), the user can visit other sites in the confirmed category 
Important
The Block Access list configured on the Cloud Apps tab (see Cloud Apps tab) takes 
precedence over actions assigned on the Web Categories tab. If a blocked cloud app

without receiving another block page. Once the time period ends, browsing to any 
other Confirm site results in another block page.
The default time can be changed on the General tab for the policy.
●
Use Quota
Users receive a block page, asking them whether to use quota time to view the 
site. If a user clicks Use Quota Time, he can view the site.
Clicking Use Quota Time starts two timers: a quota session timer and a total quota 
allocation timer.
■
If the user requests additional quota sites during a default session period (10 
minutes by default), he can visit those sites without receiving another block 
page. If you are using per-category quotas, the user can visit only other sites in 
the same category without receiving another block page.
■
Total quota time is allocated on a daily basis. Once it is used up, each user 
must wait until the next day to access sites in quota categories. The default 
daily quota allocation is set on the General tab for the policy. If you are using 
per-category quotas, the total quota time applies to each category and once it 
is used up for a particular category, a user can still use quota time in another 
category, if available.
The session length and total quota time available for each category depend on the 
options selected on the General tab. If you have defined per-category quotas, you 
can select Use Quota for a category on the Web Categories tab to change the 
total quota time and session length available to users in the policy for that 
category.
See Using quota time to limit Internet access, page 189, for more information.
●
Block access
This blocks access to websites in this category unless they exist in another 
category with that is assigned the Allow access action. If the website exists in 
another category with the action Do not block, it is blocked under this category. 
When a site is blocked, you can choose a notification page to be displayed.
Note that the block page that allows a user to View in Remote Browser is 
available for selection only if the remote browser isolation feature is enabled. See 
Configure Remote Browser Isolation for details.
Using quota time to limit Internet access
When a user clicks Use Quota Time, she can view sites in any quota category until the 
quota session ends. The default quota session time (configured via the General tab of 
the policy) is 10 minutes.
Once the quota session ends, a request for a quota site results in another quota block 
message. Users who have not depleted their daily quota allocation can start a new 
quota session.
Internet applets, such as Java or Flash applets, may not respond as expected to quota 
time restrictions. Even if it is accessed from a quota-restricted site, an applet that runs 
within the browser can continue running beyond the configured quota session time.

Defining Web Policies
190  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
This is because such applets are downloaded completely to a client machine and run 
just like applications, without communicating back to the original host server. If the 
user clicks the browser’s Refresh button, however, the cloud service detects the 
communication to the host server, and then blocks the request according to applicable 
quota restrictions.
YouTube Restricted mode
The YouTube category, which appears under Bandwidth on the Web Categories tab, 
includes the option to enable YouTube Restricted mode. 
This service allows you to limit access to the content available on YouTube, and is 
designed for use by schools, libraries and other institutions. The content that appears 
in Restricted mode is controlled by YouTube, and excludes material that contains 
potentially mature content. Videos may be flagged as restricted if mature content is 
detected by an automated system, or if a YouTube employee has set an age restriction 
to a video.
To enable the feature, select Filter using YouTube Restricted mode. Then select the 
filtering level, either Strict or Moderate.
This feature is active for end users only if the YouTube web category is not blocked. If 
you choose to block the category by default but configure exceptions for specific users 
or groups (see Exceptions, page 191), those users and groups can access the YouTube 
content that is available in Restricted mode.
Bypassing SSL decryption for specific sites
The SSL Decryption Bypass option enables you to define specific websites that are 
not subject to decryption as they flow through the proxy. Some websites may include 
personal identification information that should not be decrypted. In order to avoid 
liability for inspecting this type of information, you may want to specify some or all of 
these sites for decryption bypass. The selected sites will not be decrypted even if the 
category or categories that the sites belong to are selected for SSL analysis.
Note
YouTube Restricted mode replaces the YouTube for Schools feature, which has been 
withdrawn by YouTube.

End users can determine that the website they are viewing is not decrypted by 
checking who has issued the certificate for that site. If the certificate was issued by 
Websense, Inc., or Forcepoint LLC, traffic to the site has been decrypted.

For web applications using WebSockets for communication, the Tunnel WebSocket 
Traffic option makes it possible to automatically tunnel WebSocket traffic, 
significantly reducing the need to add SSL decryption bypasses when SSL Inspection 
is enabled.
Using this option, cloud web administrators can enable or disable WebSocket auto-
tunneling at the individual policy level allowing for phased roll-out.
To enable or disable the auto tunneling of web socket traffic:
1.
Navigate to Web > Policies > policy name > Web Categories > Tunnel 
WebSocket Traffic.
2.
Set the Automatically tunnel all WebSocket traffic for this policy option to ON 
or OFF.
Note
Auto-tunneling applies only to the Web Socket traffic for 
that web application. Regular HTTP/S traffic for that web 
application will still be subject to inspection.
Note
The default value is OFF.

Filtering action order
When a user requests access to a site, the cloud service determines whether to block or 
permit access based on the details in the policy associated with the user. See Creating 
a new policy for information. 
By default, the cloud service applies the appropriate policy enforcement action to a 
user request using these steps. If, at any step, the appropriate action is to block the 
request, the user receives the appropriate block page.

When a category exception specifies a time period, several factors affect whether the 
exception is applied:
●
If the time period includes a timezone, the timezone is used.
●
If a time period does not include a timezone, but the user request originates from a 
proxied connection that has an associated timezone, the connection’s timezone is 
used.
●
If the time period does not include a timezone, and the user is either roaming or at 
a proxied connection that has no timezone, the policy timezone is used.
●
If no timezone is available for a time period, any exceptions based on that time 
period are ineffective.
Given the considerations above, when a per-time, per-user, or per-group exception 
also exists, it applies actions in this order:
●
users with a time period defined
●
users with no time period defined
●
groups with a time period defined
●
groups with no time period defined
●

In other words, rules with a usable time period defined take precedence over 
equivalent rules with no time period.
Within each of these, the cloud service uses the same order as the default.
Category list
The cloud service uses the Forcepoint URL Database, which organizes similar 
websites (identified by URLs and IP addresses) into categories. Each category has a 
descriptive name, like Adult Material, Gambling, or Peer-to-Peer File Sharing. 
The categories include the following:
●
Advanced Malware Command and Control focuses on outbound network 
transmissions from a compromised machine to a malicious command and control 
center
●
Advanced Malware Payloads focuses on inbound network transmissions of 
payloads intended to exploit a machine
●
Mobile Malware focuses on malicious websites and applications that are 
designed to run on mobile devices
●
Unauthorized Mobile Marketplaces focuses on websites that potentially 
distribute applications that are unauthorized by the mobile operating system 
manufacturer, the handheld device manufacturer, or the network provider. (Traffic 
to websites in this category may be a sign of a jailbroken or rooted device.)
You can also create your own, custom categories or import a custom category file (in 
CSV format) to group sites of particular interest to your organization (see Configure 
custom categories). Together, the Forcepoint URL Database categories and user-
defined categories form the basis for Internet filtering.
Go to the Web > Settings > Forcepoint URL URL Database Categories link in the 
cloud portal to see an up-to-date list of Forcepoint URL Database categories.

The list on the Protocols tab includes both standard protocols and any custom 
protocols that you have defined on the Policy Management > Protocols page. The 
standard protocol groups are updated regularly.
Configure how a protocol is filtered by selecting it in the protocols tree and specifying 
an action (Allow or Block) from the box on the right. You can select a protocol 
directly from the list, or enter text in the search box to locate the protocol you want. 
Use the Shift and/or Ctrl keys to select multiple protocols.

Application Control tab
Click the Application Control tab in the policy to configure social web controls for 
your end users. This tab is available for Forcepoint Web Security Cloud only.
To use the options on the Application Control tab, you must enable Real-time Security 
Classification on the Web Content & Security tab. See the Web Content & Security 
tab, page 211.
Social web controls enable you to safely fine-tune access to popular sites within social 
media such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. For each available site, you can 
specify whether users can access particular functions within the site, such as posting a 
comment or joining a group. For example, you may want to allow users to access their 
Facebook page, but not to upload photos or videos to the site.
The following filtering actions are available for social web controls:
●
Do not block. This ensures that the function is not blocked, unless the category to 
which the parent site belongs has the action Block access. If you select Do not 
block for a function and the parent site is blocked on the Web Categories tab, a 
popup warning appears when you save your changes.

Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway Portal Help  199
Defining Web Policies
●
Block access. This blocks the function and depending on the nature of the 
function, either displays the block page that you select, stops the function from 
working, or displays an error message.
The functions specific to each site are grouped together. If you set a particular filtering 
action for the parent application (for example, Twitter), it is also applied to all child 
functions for that application. You can subsequently change the action for individual 
functions.
Top-level sites related to the social web controls remain classified and filtered under 
their existing categories on the Web Categories tab, page 185. For example, Facebook 
Chat is classified as Web Chat. You can only apply social web controls to a site if its 
corresponding web or custom category allows access or does not block the site.
If the top-level site is part of a category that has quota time applied to it, application 
controls are applied according to your configuration when the user is in a quota 
period. Similarly, if the site is in a category has the Confirm action applied to it, 
application controls are applied according to your configuration once the user has 
clicked Continue. 
To configure application controls:
1.
Select an application from the Applications list. 
You can select an application directly from the list, or enter text in the search box 
to locate the application you want. 
To select multiple applications, use the Shift and/or Ctrl keys. You can also use 
the drop-down menu above the Applications list to select or deselect all 
applications.
2.
Select an Action for the category. Note that if you have selected a parent 
application (for example Facebook or Twitter), the action you select also applies 
to all the controls within that application by default.
3.
If you have selected Block access, select a block page to display.

File Blocking tab
Click the File Blocking tab in the policy to configure file download blocking for 
categories that users are allowed to access according to your settings in the Web 
Categories tab. This capability allows your organization to restrict access to particular 
files from websites in some or all permitted categories, based on true file type, file 
extension, or size. For example, you could permit the category Sports, but block 
multimedia (audio and video) files from sites in the Sports category. 
Under Advanced Options, you can block the upload of executable files, or define file 
download size limits, or size limits per category.
The following file blocking options are available:
●
True file type blocking. True file types are detected during security analysis. 
Several predefined groups of file types (for example, common image files) are 
included on the File Blocking tab for ease of selection. 
For example:
1.
The General Email category has the Allow access action, but file type 
blocking is enabled for multimedia files in the category.
2.
An end user attempts to download a file with a known extension (for example, 
“movie.mpeg”) or unknown extension (for example, “myfile.111”).
3.
If analysis determines that the file is classified as multimedia, the user 
receives a block page indicating that the download was blocked.
4.
If analysis determines that the file is not a multimedia file, the download 
request is permitted as long as the file is not categorized as another blocked 
file type.
For more details, see Blocking by file type, page 202.
●
File extension blocking. This blocks files based solely on file extensions that you 
specify.
For example:
1.
The General Email category has the Allow access action, but the file 
extensions “.zip” and “.rar” are blocked for the category.
2.
An end user attempts to download a file with a file with a .zip extension (for 
example, “myfile.zip”).

Use this section if you want to detect intellectual property or sensitive data using 
custom phrases, dictionaries, or regular expressions containing business-specific 
terms or data.
1.
Define new classifiers on the Web > Policy Management > Content Classifiers 
page. See Configure Content Classifiers for Data Security (DLP Lite) for 
instructions. 
2.
On the Data Security tab, select the classifiers that you want to enable for the 
policy. If none are listed, none have been created yet.
3.
Select a severity for each classifier to indicate how severe a breach would be. 
Select High for the most severe breaches. Severity is used for reporting purposes. 
It allows you to easily locate High, Medium, or Low severity breaches when 
viewing reports.
4.
Where applicable, configure a threshold for each classifier. To do so, click a link 
in the Threshold column, and then indicate how many times this classifier should 
be matched to trigger an incident. You can indicate a range if desired, such as 
between 3 and 10. By default, the threshold is 1.
Also indicate if you want the system to count only unique matches when 
calculating the threshold or all matches, even duplicates. Example: your classifier 
has the key phrase “top secret” and a threshold of 5. If the key phrase is found 6 
times in a single web post, the system would count that as one match if you select 
Count only unique matches or 6 matches if you select Count all matches even 
duplicates. In the first case, the threshold is not triggered. In the second case, it is.
Suspected malware 
communication
Identifies traffic that is thought to be malware “phoning 
home” or attempting to steal information. Detection is based 
on the analysis of traffic patterns from known infected 
machines.

Advanced Classification Engine (ACE) analysis overview
ACE advanced analysis includes:
●
Real-Time Content Classification returns a category for URLs that have not 
already been blocked by the active policy, and:
■
Are not in the Forcepoint URL Database, or
■
Are classified as a dynamic site
Content classification adapts to rapidly-changing web content, including user-
generated content, such as that found on social-networking sites.
Optionally, you can select Analyze links embedded in Web content as part of 
content classification to provide more accurate categorization of certain types of 
content. For example, a page that otherwise has little or no undesirable content, 
but that links to sites known to have undesirable content, can be more accurately

categorized. Link analysis is particularly good at finding malicious links 
embedded in hidden parts of a page, and in detecting pages returned by image 
servers that link thumbnails to undesirable sites. 
●
Real-Time Security Classification analyzes web pages in real time to discover 
security threats and malicious code in HTTP. You can enable advanced analysis 
for one of the following:
■
Sites with elevated risk profiles, as identified by Security Labs
■
Sites with elevated risk profiles and sites with lower risk profiles. Note that 
analyzing all inbound content is resource intensive and may result in slower 
web performance.
You must enable Real-Time Security Classification to use the options on the 
Application Controls tab. See Application Control tab, page 198.
●
Antivirus File Analysis - Inbound analyzes files using traditional antivirus (AV) 
definitions to find virus-infected files that users are attempting to download.
●
Advanced Detection File Analysis - Inbound analyzes files using advanced 
detection techniques to discover malicious content, such as viruses, Trojan horses, 
and worms, returning a threat category for policy enforcement.
You can configure the specific types of files to analyze under File Type Analysis 
Options. Note that executable file analysis is configured separately (see 
Configuring file analysis, page 214).
●
Rich Internet Application Analysis is applied to active content like Flash and 
Silverlight to detect and block malicious content.
There are also two ACE outbound traffic analysis options that are enabled by default 
and cannot be turned off. This ensures that viruses and other malicious content cannot 
be sent from your network.
●
Antivirus and Advanced Detection File Analysis - Outbound parallels the 
inbound file analysis applied by the Antivirus File Analysis and Advanced 
Detection File Analysis. 
●
Bot and Spyware “phone home” Traffic Analysis detects phone-home 
communication attempts from malware in your network and ensures that they are 
categorized and blocked.
Note
For an I Series appliance deployment, when performance optimization is selected 
the cloud service analyzes only sites with elevated risk profiles. 
Note
If file analysis is configured to include multimedia files, when the streaming media 
is buffered and analyzed, the connection to the server may time out. In such cases, 
the best remedy is to create an analysis exception for that site. See Analysis 
exceptions, page 215.

Forcepoint Cloud Security Gateway Portal Help  213
Defining Web Policies
The cloud service must analyze and block outbound malicious traffic in order to 
protect itself from being perceived as a malicious actor. Some origin servers blocklist 
client IP addresses if they detect malicious communications or hack attempts. If 
malicious communications were permitted to go through cloud proxies, the proxies 
would be in blocklist. This could mean that a single infected client could cause all 
clients browsing via the same cluster to be in blocklist.
This traffic is also logged, so you can run a report to obtain a list of the infected 
computers in your network.

The Metrics list, in the left pane, contains options that you can add as columns to 
the report. Drag metrics into and out of the report results area to add them to or 
remove them from the report. The available metrics change depending on the 
attributes that are selected.

All web reports contain Hits as the primary metric, as signified by a star in the 
column name. To change the primary metric, drag a second metric to the report 
and then sort by that new metric to make it the primary. For more information, see 
Report Builder metrics.
●
In the right pane, the Grouping field can contain up to 2 attributes to define the 
data grouping that appears in the report. For example, in a web report, if you drag 
the Category attribute followed by the Action attribute into this field, this creates a 
summary report on hits by category, and also displays the data broken down by 
action within those categories. In an email report, if you drag the Policy attribute 
followed by the Recipient Address attribute into this field, this creates a summary 
report on messages by policy, and also displays the data broken down by recipient 
addresses within those policies. For more information about defining grouping 
data, see Creating a report.
●
The Filters field can contain attributes to filter the report results further. For more 
information about defining filters, see Creating a report.
●
The Date range defines the time period covered by the report. This can be a 
standard period (between 1 hour and 8 months) or a specific date and time range. 
Note
If you add the Browse Time metric to your report, note that the browse time totals 
may not be accurate for second-level grouping data. 
For example, if you create a report with the first attribute as User and the second as 
Domain, and a user goes to 2 different sites within the same minute the browse time 
totals are correct at the first level for the user, but at the second level the 2 sites are 
each allocated 1 minute of browse time. Therefore you cannot accurately add up the 
browse time totals at the second level.

You can also choose whether to automatically detect the time zone for the report, 
or choose a specific time zone from the drop-down list.

Exporting data to a third-party SIEM tool
Use the Reporting > Account Reports > SIEM Integration page to format reporting 
data for use by a third-party SIEM tool. Select data columns and apply filters to the 
data, just as you do in other areas of the Report Center (for Web, see Using the 
Transaction Viewer, for Email, see Using Message Details). 
Before data can be exported, you need to configure SIEM Storage details. Navigate 
to Account > SIEM Storage to select a storage type and configure your own storage 
if you do not wish to use Forcepoint storage (the default). See Configuring SIEM 
storage for details.
After selecting the type of data that you want to export to your SIEM tool, define the 
data format, and enable SIEM data export.
To configure and enable SIEM integration:
1.
Select a data type (Web Security or Email Security) from the drop-down list. Note 
that:
■
You can select one or both options.
■
Only options appropriate to your account are displayed.
2.
Use the Columns drop-down list, or drag items into the report panel from the 
Attributes or Metrics lists to customize the information that will appear in the 
exported data. You can drag columns in the report panel to re-order them.
The default columns vary, depending on which data type you have selected.
The number of columns allowed also varies, depending on the data type. For Web 
Security, the limit is 35. For Email Security, the limit is 25.
See Report attributes: Web and Data Security or Email report attributes for 
additional infomation.
3.
Drag items from the Attributes or Metrics lists to the Filters field to define any 
filters you want to apply to your reporting data before it is exported. On the popup 
that appers, use the drop-down list to define how the filter handles the value that 
you specify.

Using Bring your own storage
The output generated by the export process is forwarded to the active AWS S3 bucket 
listed on the SIEM Storage page. Files are assigned names using the format 
web|email_<accountid>_<timestamp>_<server>_<timestamp>.csv.gz, and will use 
any prefix values defined for the bucket. 
Note
You can click a column heading to sort the data by the entries in that column. This 
may be useful to check that the export will include the data that you want. However, 
note that this sort will not be applied to the data that is exported.
Note
Enable data export cannot be set to ON unless a valid storage option has been 
configured on Account > SIEM Storage.
The option is automatically set to OFF if:
●Forcepoint storage is enabled but no logs have been downloaded for 30 days.
●Bring your own storage is enabled but no SIEM data could be forwarded to the active 
bucket for 14 days.

Using Forcepoint storage
To get the formatted SIEM data to your network, you can either use the sample Perl 
script included in the zip file linked at the top of the SIEM integration page, or create 
a script of your own. The account used to run this script must have “Log Export” 
permissions (see Running the SIEM log file download script for Forcepoint storage, 
page 236, for more information about using the script) but permission to log onto the 
portal is not required.
To download the sample script:
1.
Click the link in the introductory text on the SIEM Integration page.
2.
Save the file to a location of your choice and unzip it. It contains 4 files and 
provides all you need to run the script. 
■
A set of binary library files.
■
Aconfiguration file that can be used to pass parameters to the script.Then, use 
the cfg file parameter when you execute the script.  See Running the SIEM log 
file download script for Forcepoint storage.
Note that adding parameters to the command line when executing the script 
will override the parameters in the config file.
■
The default script file.
■
a ReadMe file with details on how to handle the other files.
The set of library files and the script should always be kept together in the same 
folder. The configuation file can be located in a different folder, if necessary. The 
path to it can be included in the cfg file paramter. 
The script can be run on Windows or Linux, and does the following:
●
Connects to the cloud service using the URL specified in the script
●
Optionally reports the log files available for download
Note
If you give this contact only the Log Export permission and nothing else, the user 
name and password cannot be used to log on to the cloud portal. Although log on 
permissions are not needed to run the script, the View Reports permission is the 
minimum permission a user needs to be able to log on.
Minimum permissions should be given to this user. The user password is needed to 
run the script and is viewable in plain text. For that reason, it is recommended that 
this user not be one with permissions to modify reports or account policies.
Warning
Forcepoint provides the sample log download script as a convenience to its 
customers, but does not provide support for customization and will not be 
responsible for any problems that may arise from editing the script.

Report Center
236  Forcepoint Web Security Cloud
●
Downloads the available log files to a location of your choice, or by default to the 
directory where the script is located
●
Optionally checks the MD5 hash of each downloaded file to verify the file’s 
integrity before deletion from the server
●
Uses the HTTP DELETE method to exclude downloaded files from the list of 
files to be processed. 
Whether they have been downloaded or not, files that are 14 days old are deleted.
If you customize the sample script or choose to write your own script, you must 
always include the DELETE method to avoid listing the same files again and to 
remove the downloaded files from the server. This is because files are only retained 
for 14 days.
Optionally, you can use the Windows Scheduler or Linux cron and crontab 
commands to schedule the script to run at regular intervals. Use the infinite_loop 
option (see Running the SIEM log file download script for Forcepoint storage) to run 
the script as a backgroud process.
For information about using the sample script, see Running the SIEM log file 
download script for Forcepoint storage, page 236.
Running the SIEM log file download script for Forcepoint storage
You can use the parameters described below to customize the sample download script 
used to download reporting logs from the cloud service for use by your SIEM tool.
Some parameters have a short form (for example, -v) and a long form (for example, 
--verbose). For these parameters, both options are listed.
Note
Running the script on Windows requires a Perl distribution, which you can 
download from http://www.perl.org/get.html. 
The script (par file) contains all of the necessary modules, but, should you need to 
install them manually, a list of the required modules is included in the ReadMe that 
is part of the zip file.
Parameter
Description
-u <username>
--username

For cloud web products, the Endpoint Auditing report, used for the classic 
endpoint agents, lists the current status of all endpoints deployed to users and 
workstations in your organization.
●
If you have identity management enabled for your account, you can generate 
synchronization statistics for the service.
All reports are generated in real time using the cloud manager. Most include charts 
and tables that are presented in an easy to read, printable format.
Commonly-used report criteria can be saved for easy access. For more information, 
see Saving reports, page 268. Saved reports can be scheduled for regular delivery to 
one or more recipients as described in Scheduling reports, page 269.

status of all users and client machines with the endpoint installed. 
By default the report displays the status of all endpoint users updated in the last 7 
days, listing user names, workstation names, and the current endpoint status.
●
To filter the report for one or more user names, enter the names in the search field 
and click Search.
●
To change the report to list a particular endpoint status, select one of the following 
from the Endpoint status drop-down:
■
Enabled – all endpoints that are currently enabled
■
Enabled (manually) – endpoints that have been manually enabled by the end 
user
■
Enabled (auto-recovery) – endpoints that have automatically returned to an 
enabled state following a period of fallback due to a lack of connection with 
the cloud service
■
Enabled (system restart) – endpoints that have been automatically re-
enabled on machine restart
■
Disabled (manually) – endpoints that have been manually disabled by the 
end user
■
Fallback mode – endpoints that cannot connect with the cloud service fall 
back to one of two modes. For Proxy Connect endpoints, the system allows 
requests to go directly to the local network/Internet. For Direct Connect 
endpoints, the system applies filters that have been cached for previously 
blocked sites before sending requests to the Internet.
The Fallback mode for Neo is configurable and can be set to allow the user 
request, block the user request, or use local cache to apply policy.
●
To edit the time period, select an option from the Status updated drop-down. 
●
To see further details for a particular user or workstation, click the user or

Considerations for existing customers (LDAP)
If you have already set up users, groups, passwords, policies, and exceptions in the 
cloud manager and you want to switch to LDAP synchronization, consider the 
following:
●
You can minimize the impact by carefully matching your LDAP group names and 
membership to the existing setup. Matching LDAP group names and membership 
to those already in the cloud service allows existing policy selections and settings 
to be maintained, as well as existing usernames/passwords where applicable.
●
You are responsible for avoiding ambiguous configurations, for example, users 
belonging to multiple groups which are assigned to different policies. It is up to 
you to set up groups in the LDAP directories in such a way that ambiguities don't 
occur. (When there are ambiguities, the service selects the closest group-to-policy 
assignment for each individual user, taking the first group in alphabetical order 
where there are multiple assignments at the same hierarchical level.)
●
Existing users can retain their passwords and whether you manage users through 
the portal, LDAP synchronization, or both is completely transparent to them.
Existing Web customers (SCIM)

there are ambiguities, the service selects the closest group-to-policy assignment

●
Existing users can retain their cloud web local passwords and whether you 
manage users through the portal, SCIM, or both is completely transparent to them.
If you are already using Directory Synchronization and would like to switch to SCIM:
●
In order to maintain your existing users, ensure that the information for each user 
contains a synced email address that is equivalent to their UPN. This allows the 
service to match the user using the email address when it receives SCIM 
provisioning requests and allows for a seamless move fro Directory 
Synchronization to SCIM.
●
If synced email addresses are not possible, a provisioning reset is recommended to 
avoid user duplication and additional management complexity and overhead. In 
this case, SCIM users will appear as new users. Note, however, that history 
reporting information for the directory synchronized users will no longer be 
available after the reset.

Data Security Content 
Classifiers (DLP Lite only)  
For your convenience, Forcepoint Web Security Cloud includes predefined data 
security content classifiers to detect and report on data loss in your organization and 
help you conform to industry regulations in your geo-location.
Predefined classifiers enable you to quickly and easily define what type of content is 
considered a security breach on your network. 
Many policies are disabled by default, but you can enable them in the cloud portal by 
navigating to the Data Security tab of your web policy.
You can also create custom data security classifiers on the Policy Management > 
Content Classifiers page.
The predefined classifiers included in the cloud service are constantly being updated 
and improved. There are several types of policies:
