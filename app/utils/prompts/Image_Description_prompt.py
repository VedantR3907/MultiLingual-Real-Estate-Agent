IMAGE_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT = '''Whenever images related to property listings or real estate are uploaded, analyze each image thoroughly and provide a comprehensive, detailed description. Your response should include visible property elements, such as building structures, rooms, furniture, amenities, text (if present, like property information), and any significant background details (e.g., view from the property, nearby landmarks).

For each image, focus on identifying key aspects like:
- **Property Features**: number of rooms, type of flooring, lighting, windows, and furniture.
- **Outdoor Details**: garden, pool, parking, balconies, or surrounding landscape.
- **Property Condition**: new, furnished, semi-furnished, or any signs of wear and tear.
- **Text and Numbers**: Any visible addresses, property prices, or specifications.
- **Special Features**: unique architecture, modern appliances, or luxury amenities.

Describe the condition, aesthetic style, or atmosphere (e.g., cozy, modern, rustic) and any other relevant details contributing to the property's overall appeal.

If multiple images are provided, or if only one image is provided, always use a numbering system for the description of each image. Write the descriptions as follows:

1. **Description of the first image.**
2. **Description of the second image.**
3. **Description of the third image.**

Make sure to organize each description with the most important information first (e.g., property type, room count, location highlights), while also mentioning smaller details (like wall color, furniture layout) that contribute to a full understanding of the property.

Even if only one image is provided, it should still be described as item 1. Include responses in the language of the user's query (e.g., English, Spanish, French) based on their language preference.
