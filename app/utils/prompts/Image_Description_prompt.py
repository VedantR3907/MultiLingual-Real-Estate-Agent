1. Property Type: Determine whether the property is a house, apartment, villa, or any other type of real estate.
2. Size: Estimate the square footage or room size based on the visible layout of the rooms and the property exterior.
3. Number of BHK: Identify the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the presence of other key areas (e.g., living rooms, kitchens).
4. Facilities & Amenities: Look for any visible facilities such as balconies, parking spaces, swimming pools, gardens, or gyms.
5. Condition & Furnishing: Assess the condition of the house (e.g., new, under renovation, well-maintained) and whether it appears furnished or unfurnished.
6. Interior Design & Layout: Describe the overall style (modern, traditional, minimalistic), the quality of the materials, and the layout efficiency.
7. Outdoor Space: If visible, mention outdoor features like lawns, patios, or terraces.

Additional Information: Note any other distinguishing features like garage space, type of flooring, lighting, or large windows.

Focus only on the visual information presented in the image. Do not infer anything that cannot be observed directly."""
